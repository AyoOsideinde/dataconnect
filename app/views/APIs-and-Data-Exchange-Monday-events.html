<p>With the climate emergency looming, sea-levels are rising, the weather is becoming more extreme and erratic, so a real-world example would be the ever-increasing threat of flooding. In the UK Met Office records show that 9 of the 17 record-breaking rainfall months or seasons since 1910 have occurred within the last 20 years. </p>
<p>Chris Hansford will talk us through how the use of publicly available data can be used to help alert, warn and protect us from these catastrophic weather events. All welcome.</p>
