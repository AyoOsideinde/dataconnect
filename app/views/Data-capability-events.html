<h2>Thursday - </h2><h2><div id="Thursday-1-00pm-to-2-00pm-Building-DDaT-capability-and-skills-across-the-UK">1.00pm to 2.00pm: Building DDaT capability and skills across the UK</div></h2><p>The Declaration on Government Reform policy paper, published in June, outlines how the Civil Service and Ministers will reform government together to deliver better for citizens.</p>
<p>It states, “We will look beyond London to all corners of the UK, as part of our mission to be a government more like the country we serve. More civil servants, including senior leaders, will work outside of the capital, joining the many dedicated front line staff already based in towns and cities across the UK.”</p>
<p>Therefore, a key action for 2021 is to implement plans to move 22,000 roles out of London by 2030, including 50% of Senior Civil Servant (SCS) roles, confirming at least five major departmental relocations this year.</p>
<p>As part of the GDS and Central Digital and Data Office location strategy, many new roles will be created in Manchester and Bristol, across a range of professions and capabilities, for the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>This session from Manchester Digital will discuss the current digital and data skills picture in Manchester and the UK, the challenges employers can overcome, and the initiatives that can be used to recruit and retain UK wide digital, data and technology specialists.</p>

Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. We’ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at Open Data Institute Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal.

It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

Data science mentors provide advice and guidance to help a colleague develop technical skills through working on an analytical project. From a knotty technical question or new insight from their mentees’ data, to a different approach to project management or simply a new way of using Github, mentors report that they gain new skills and knowledge through mentoring others. It also provides opportunities their current role may not, such as demonstrating and developing skills like coaching, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>If you would like to share your data science skills and knowledge, learning yourself while helping others grow, there is a range of mentoring opportunities available at various skill levels. This session will provide an in-depth look at the data science mentoring movement and how you can be a part of it. It will provide more information on what’s involved, the programmes available and the support provided. There will also be an opportunity to put your questions to a panel of experienced data science mentors.</p>

I have been an R user for a long time now but have recently discovered the world of Python with much enthusiasm!</li>
<li>Chris Beeley: Chris works in a team of data scientists in Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. The team carries out nationally funded work providing open source analytical solutions within text mining, forecasting, and Shiny application development, as well as providing analytic support to the Trust and the ICS in regard of statistical analysis of routinely collected clinical outcomes. Chris’s expertise within the team is mainly in writing and deploying R/ Shiny applications on top of databases as well as statistical analysis and psychometrics. Chris is also the co-chair of the technical advisory group of the NHS-R Community.</li></ul></p>

Working closely with ministers, as one government, our shared focus on these priorities will enable us to achieve our vision of A Modern Civil Service that is more skilled, innovative and ambitious.</p>
<p>We believe there’s huge potential to use data better in government, strengthening staff tools, saving taxpayers’ money and improving outcomes for citizens.</p>
<p>This sounds all well and good, but what does it mean for you? In this plenary, led by the Modernisation and Reform Unit, we focus on the action government is taking to drive digital and data innovation. You will hear about some of the key projects and programmes taking<br>
place across government. You'll learn what they look like on the ground and how they will make a difference to your working life.</p>
<p>You will meet Modernisation and Reform Champions from the data community. And hear more about why they have joined the Champions network, what they are doing to make a difference, and why you should sign-up!</p>
<p>With the opportunity to ask questions at the end, you’ll come away from this workshop as excited and inspired by our vision for A Modern Civil Service as we are!</p>

<h2>Friday - </h2><h2><div id="Friday-2-00pm-to-3-00pm-Boosting-data-science-capability-through-collaborations-outside-the-public-sector-ONS-">2:00pm to 3:00pm Boosting data science capability through collaborations outside the public sector (ONS)</div></h2><p>The ONS Data Science Campus Capability Team are carrying out a review of our collaborations with Academic Institutions, Commercial Organisations, Charities and NSI’s (amongst others). As part of this review, we would like to speak with colleagues across public sector organisations to determine:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>what collaborations they have had/have with these kinds of organisations (with a focus on using collaborations to increase data science capability)</li>
<li>the successes and /or failures of these collaborations</li>
<li>whether they would be interested in utilising our collaborative agreements to increase data science capability within their organisations</li>
<li>how collaborative agreements can be used to increase data science capability across the public sector</li></ul></p>
<p>We would also like to hear from organisations outside of the public sector with regards to their experiences of collaborating to increase data science capability and are also keen to hear from organisations that are interested in collaborating with us.</p>
