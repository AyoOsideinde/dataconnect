We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.</p>
<p>We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.</p>
<p>In this session we will discuss:<ul><br>
<li>- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations</li>
<li>- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions</li>
<li>- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise</li>
</ul></p>
<p>This session will be followed by a hands on implementation workshop on Friday: <a href="https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-">https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-</a><br>
