<p><h2>Wednesday</h2></p><h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

Integrated Data Service (IDS) is for analysts in government, Devolved Administrations and external researchers to provide controlled access to a series of integrated Critical National Data Assets built, linked and maintained for deep analysis. In this session, Dominic Hale, the Head of Strategy for the Integrated Data Service will provide an overview of IDS, the achievements so far and the plans for the future.<br>
This session is for government employees only. <br>
</p>
<p>Format: Presentation and discussion<br>Speakers:<br> Dominic Hale is the Head of Strategy for the Integrated Data Service. His role includes setting the strategic direction of the programme, while ensuring alignment to government priorities and transformation across the DDAT domain, including the National Data Strategy & Declaration on Government Reform. Dominic has a strong background in project delivery and data analysis, having spent the last decade within the digital and data arena and previous to that, as an analyst.<br>Ruth James is the Strategic Cross Government Lead for the Integrated Data Programme. Her role involves engagement across government to ensure the programme delivers on collaborative commitments and priorities. Ruth has worked in data, research and official statistics for many years and has held a variety of roles including design of data collection practices, assessment of official statistics, and more recently in data strategy and governance. <br>Connect: <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">https://www.ons.gov.uk/</a><br>Date and time: 29th September, 9:45am to 10:30am<br>Length of session: 45 minutes<br> Registration and joining information: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-uks-integrated-data-service-dataconnect21-registration-170472114684 ">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-uks-integrated-data-service-dataconnect21-registration-170472114684 </a></p>

As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.</p>
<p>Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy. The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.</p>
<p>This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.</p>

This makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what. Over the summer, the Open Data Institute (ODI) has been crowdsourcing a list of the UK government organisations responsible for data and the projects they're involved in. In this session, the ODI discuss what they found with key data leaders in government.</p> <br>

A joint session from Public Health England and Joint Biosecurity Centre on two innovations in collection, sharing and using public health data.<br>Joint Biosecurity Centre: The pandemic has uncovered the need - and potential - for novel, non-traditional health data to inform the health protection response. A limitation of translating non-health data in public health action is determining the most relevant level of geography. In the UK, the administrative and statistical building blocks coincide at the Local Authority level. However, Local Authority boundaries do not necessarily capture the way communities actually live and work. We have been looking at alternative ways to aggregate data to address this problem. This will be illustrated through the case of Wastewater monitoring.<br>Public Health England: The UK coronavirus dashboard is the government source of data on the pandemic and is praised by national and international bodies, including the Prime Minister, Health Secretary, National Statistician, and members of the public for its comprehensiveness, integrity, and agility. The talk will look at how PHE have produced the dashboard, with a particular focus on the use of APIs.</p>

Data science mentors provide advice and guidance to help a colleague develop technical skills through working on an analytical project. From a knotty technical question or new insight from their mentees’ data, to a different approach to project management or simply a new way of using Github, mentors report that they gain new skills and knowledge through mentoring others. It also provides opportunities their current role may not, such as demonstrating and developing skills like coaching, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>If you would like to share your data science skills and knowledge, learning yourself while helping others grow, there is a range of mentoring opportunities available at various skill levels. This session will provide an in-depth look at the data science mentoring movement and how you can be a part of it. It will provide more information on what’s involved, the programmes available and the support provided. There will also be an opportunity to put your questions to a panel of experienced data science mentors.</p>
