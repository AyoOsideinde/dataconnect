<p><h2>Wednesday</h2></p><h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

Integrated Data Service (IDS) is for analysts in government, Devolved Administrations and external researchers to provide controlled access to a series of integrated Critical National Data Assets built, linked and maintained for deep analysis. In this session, Dominic Hale, the Head of Strategy for the Integrated Data Service will provide an overview of IDS, the achievements so far and the plans for the future.<br>
This session is for government employees only. <br>

As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.</p>
<p>Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy. The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.</p>
<p>This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.</p>

This makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what. Over the summer, the Open Data Institute (ODI) has been crowdsourcing a list of the UK government organisations responsible for data and the projects they're involved in. In this session, the ODI discuss what they found with key data leaders in government.</p> <br>
