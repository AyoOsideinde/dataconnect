Improving coherence of government statistics (GSS Housing and Homelessness team)<br>
<br>
Short description<br>
The COVID-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of providing the public with coherent and accessible statistics where there are multiple producers.<br>
<br>
As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.<br>
<br>
Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy.<br>
<br>
The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.<br>
<br>
This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.<br>

This makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what. Over the summer, the Open Data Institute has been crowdsourcing a list of the UK government organisations responsible for data and the projects they're involved in. In this session, the ODI discuss what they found with key data leaders in government. <br>
