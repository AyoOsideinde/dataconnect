The Environment Agency is classed as a First responder and as such it is vital that the data they get is as near real time as is possible, especially when citizensâ€™ lives and livelihoods depend on it. 
With the climate emergency looming, sea-levels are rising, the weather is becoming more extreme and erratic, so a real-world example would be the ever-increasing threat of flooding.
In the UK Met Office records show that 9 of the 17 record-breaking rainfall months or seasons since 1910 have occurred within the last 20 years.  Chris Hansford will talk us through how the use of publicly available data can be used to help alert, warn and protect us from these catastrophic weather events.
