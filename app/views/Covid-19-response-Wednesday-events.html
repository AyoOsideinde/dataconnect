A joint session from Public Health England and Joint Biosecurity Centre on two innovations in collection, sharing and using public health data.<br>Joint Biosecurity Centre: The pandemic has uncovered the need - and potential - for novel, non-traditional health data to inform the health protection response. A limitation of translating non-health data in public health action is determining the most relevant level of geography. In the UK, the administrative and statistical building blocks coincide at the Local Authority level. However, Local Authority boundaries do not necessarily capture the way communities actually live and work. We have been looking at alternative ways to aggregate data to address this problem. This will be illustrated through the case of Wastewater monitoring.<br>Public Health England: The UK coronavirus dashboard is the government source of data on the pandemic and is praised by national and international bodies, including the Prime Minister, Health Secretary, National Statistician, and members of the public for its comprehensiveness, integrity, and agility. The talk will look at how PHE have produced the dashboard, with a particular focus on the use of APIs.</p>
