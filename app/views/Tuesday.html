<p><h3>9:30 - 11:00 SWIRRL: Practical experiences in connecting government data</h3><br>Practical experiences in connecting government data with EA and ONS - in this session Swirrl will explain why it’s useful to make data more connectable and what people are trying to achieve.

Our ONS and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes
- explain why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources.
- present practical examples seen in the Integrated Data Programme work with ONS, and with the Environment Agency
- how we’re tackling it, covering both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations - and illustrate this with real examples
- discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy

<p><h3>11:00 - 12:00 OPEN DATA INSTITUTE LEEDS: Creative Collaborative Data Challenge Communities</h3><br>At ODI Leeds we have a firm belief in the network effect of a strong community around a data challenge. Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. We’ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at ODI Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal.<br>61127e8337b97c858c7145e4,610c5aaf60187f5adf643da3,610bfb8edf35781d3d9c7b10</p>

<p><h3>15:00 - 16:00 ENVIRONMENT AGENCY: Data Literacy – What is it and what do I do with it?</h3><br>Data Literacy – What is it and what do I do with it?

<br>Short description<br>
Organisations, unlike a lot of Government Departments are constantly looking for the competitive edge to remain successful, profitable and, ultimately, long-lasting.  However regardless of whether you work with a Multi-national Organisation or a Government Dept data is central to that success. Unfortunately, what is becoming apparent is that the vast majority of employees within organisations don’t have the confidence with data to truly unlock its potential.   In fact,  research shows that only 1 in 4 business decision makers would categorise themselves as being fully data literate. At executive level, this number is about 1 in 3. And, crucially, organisations don’t know what steps to take to rectify the skills gap – to place data literacy at the heart of their business.
