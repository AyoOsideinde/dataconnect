<h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-Voices-of-the-public-using-free-text-data">10:00am to 11:00am Voices of the public; using free text data</div></h2><p>Description: In health, we collect a lot of free-text feedback from patients and citizens. In DHSC and the NHS, we have developed reusable methods for extracting actionable analysis out of this data. In this session, we will show off our open source tools and give an overview of work in this area.</p>
<p>Format: Show and tell</p>
<p>Who the session is aimed at: Analysts with some knowledge of R or Python, and data owners of large volumes of text</p>
<p>The speakers:<ul><br>
<li>Dr. Dan Schofield: Senior Data Scientist in the Innovation Branch of the NHSX Analytics Unit.  Strong interest in Natural Language Processing, especially in situations related to the NHS, as well as advances in explainability of ‘black box’ models, and deployment of solutions such that they have the greatest impact.</li>
<li>Martine Wauben: Lead Data Scientist at DHSC’s data science hub. We help analytical teams use data science practices and techniques on projects including COVID-19, medicines supply, and consultation analysis. I support data science capability and community building across health and social care, and advocate for open code and sharing across silos.</li>
<li>Andreas Soteriades: An Applied Mathematician with Data Science experience in both academic and non-research areas, from dairy farm efficiency modelling to Text Mining (plus a few other in between!). I am currently crunching NHS patient feedback data with Scikit-learn (Python) and tidytext (R) and translating findings into an illuminating dashboard (Shiny/Golem) for managers and non-technical staff. I have been an R user for a long time now but have recently discovered the world of Python with much enthusiasm!</li>
<li>Chris Beeley: Chris works in a team of data scientists in Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. The team carries out nationally funded work providing open source analytical solutions within text mining, forecasting, and Shiny application development, as well as providing analytic support to the Trust and the ICS in regard of statistical analysis of routinely collected clinical outcomes. Chris’s expertise within the team is mainly in writing and deploying R/ Shiny applications on top of databases as well as statistical analysis and psychometrics. Chris is also the co-chair of the technical advisory group of the NHS-R Community.</li></ul></p>

<p>Local Authorities in Scotland have joined forces with the Digital Office for Scottish Local Government to understand how they can use data to achieve positive outcomes for their organisations, the wider sector, and citizens. The Data Task Force are also collaborating with the Scottish Government on a number of challenges from improving data maturity, the development of a Data Transformation Framework, and to make it easier to find public sector data through a CivTech Innovation Challenge.</p>

Working closely with ministers, as one government, our shared focus on these priorities will enable us to achieve our vision of A Modern Civil Service that is more skilled, innovative and ambitious.</p>
<p>We believe there’s huge potential to use data better in government, strengthening staff tools, saving taxpayers’ money and improving outcomes for citizens.</p>
<p>This sounds all well and good, but what does it mean for you? In this plenary, led by the Modernisation and Reform Unit, we focus on the action government is taking to drive digital and data innovation. You will hear about some of the key projects and programmes taking<br>
place across government. You'll learn what they look like on the ground and how they will make a difference to your working life.</p>
<p>You will meet Modernisation and Reform Champions from the data community. And hear more about why they have joined the Champions network, what they are doing to make a difference, and why you should sign-up!</p>
<p>With the opportunity to ask questions at the end, you’ll come away from this workshop as excited and inspired by our vision for A Modern Civil Service as we are!</p>

As part of this review, we would like to speak with colleagues across public sector organisations to determine:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>what collaborations they have had/have with these kinds of organisations (with a focus on using collaborations to increase data science capability)</li>
<li>the successes and /or failures of these collaborations</li>
<li>whether they would be interested in utilising our collaborative agreements to increase data science capability within their organisations</li>
<li>how collaborative agreements can be used to increase data science capability across the public sector</li></ul></p>
<p>We would also like to hear from organisations outside of the public sector with regards to their experiences of collaborating to increase data science capability and are also keen to hear from organisations that are interested in collaborating with us.</p>
