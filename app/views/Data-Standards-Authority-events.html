<h2>Tuesday - </h2><h2><div id="Tuesday-11-00am-to-12-00pm-ICO-CDEI-Privacy-Enhancing-Technologies-and-lowering-barriers-to-adoption">11:00am to 12:00pm (ICO / CDEI) Privacy Enhancing Technologies and lowering barriers to adoption</div></h2><p> In this session the ICO and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) will address some common myths and misconceptions about identifiability, and provide an overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and how they can be used by government teams interested in applying them but unsure of where to begin. Despite the significant benefits they offer, the development and adoption of PETs has been slow due to various factors. <br>
The ICO will be addressing some of the perceived barriers to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty as they release guidance on PETs later in 2021. As part of its work on enabling data sharing, the ICO is developing regulatory guidance and tools on anonymisation, pseudonymisation and PETs. The use of effective anonymisation techniques gives organisations the ability to share data more widely as anonymous information is outside the scope of data protection legislation. Their latest chapter of the anonymisation guidance, ‘How do we ensure anonymisation is effective?’, covers the critical topic of identifiability and what data protection law requires you to do when assessing whether your approach results in effective anonymisation.<br>
The team will discuss how data protection law applies where someone is ‘identified or identifiable’ and the concept of identifiability and how this is assessed in practice. Finally, it will discuss data protection in the context of PETs, including identifiability and key factors an organisation should consider. As part of the session, the team will also be running polls to gather audience opinion on key topics, for example, how the motivated intruder test can best be articulated for the future and our spectrum of identifiability approach.<br>
The CDEI will showcase the research it has done on PETs, the Centre’s understanding of policy and regulation issues, share our use case repository and walk through the adoption guide using an interactive case study exercise. The CDEI will also highlight the limitations of PETs and where they may not be a solution to privacy problems, with the aim to cut through some of the hype around these technologies. The CDEI hopes to crowdsource key problem areas where PETs are a compelling solution and build fruitful relationships with government stakeholders which could lead to future collaboration on projects demonstrating the value of PETs.</p>

It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

This event is an open discussion of the kinds of features we as data practitioners of various types would like to have in the data catalogues we use. The event is particularly aimed at people who actively interact with data catalogues of various kinds, who have a sense of the limitations of current systems and the capabilities we wish they had and sharing of any best-practices or principles.</p>
<p>Primary audience: data scientists, developers, data curators, data governance managers who use data catalogues and related tools. Also potentially useful to data team managers, CDOs and other leaders.</p>

<h2>Friday - </h2><h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-Voices-of-the-public-using-free-text-data">10:00am to 11:00am Voices of the public; using free text data</div></h2><p>Description: In health, we collect a lot of free-text feedback from patients and citizens. In DHSC and the NHS, we have developed reusable methods for extracting actionable analysis out of this data. In this session, we will show off our open source tools and give an overview of work in this area.</p>
<p>Format: Show and tell</p>
<p>Who the session is aimed at: Analysts with some knowledge of R or Python, and data owners of large volumes of text</p>
<p>The speakers:<ul><br>
<li>Dr. Dan Schofield: Senior Data Scientist in the Innovation Branch of the NHSX Analytics Unit.  Strong interest in Natural Language Processing, especially in situations related to the NHS, as well as advances in explainability of ‘black box’ models, and deployment of solutions such that they have the greatest impact.</li>
<li>Martine Wauben: Lead Data Scientist at DHSC’s data science hub. We help analytical teams use data science practices and techniques on projects including COVID-19, medicines supply, and consultation analysis. I support data science capability and community building across health and social care, and advocate for open code and sharing across silos.</li>
<li>Andreas Soteriades: An Applied Mathematician with Data Science experience in both academic and non-research areas, from dairy farm efficiency modelling to Text Mining (plus a few other in between!). I am currently crunching NHS patient feedback data with Scikit-learn (Python) and tidytext (R) and translating findings into an illuminating dashboard (Shiny/Golem) for managers and non-technical staff. I have been an R user for a long time now but have recently discovered the world of Python with much enthusiasm!</li>
<li>Chris Beeley: Chris works in a team of data scientists in Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. The team carries out nationally funded work providing open source analytical solutions within text mining, forecasting, and Shiny application development, as well as providing analytic support to the Trust and the ICS in regard of statistical analysis of routinely collected clinical outcomes. Chris’s expertise within the team is mainly in writing and deploying R/ Shiny applications on top of databases as well as statistical analysis and psychometrics. Chris is also the co-chair of the technical advisory group of the NHS-R Community.</li></ul></p>

<h2>Friday - </h2><h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-A-citizen-first-approach-to-getting-value-from-APIs-in-government">10.00am to 11.00am - A citizen-first approach to getting value from APIs in government</div></h2><p>Governments globally are increasingly exploring ways to deliver more value from services to a greater population of the wider community, using data exchange via APIs to enable them. Learning from case studies and techniques that have been proven overseas and in other industry sectors, can help build the case for, and extract more value from, API-related investment. This  session shares research and insights from case studies and API programs in government and non-government sectors.</p>
