<h2><div id="Tuesday-9-30am-to-11-00am-Practical-experiences-in-connecting-government-data">9:30am to 11:00am Practical experiences in connecting government data</div></h2><p>Description: In this session Swirrl will explain why it’s useful to make data more connectable and what people are trying to achieve. Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources. We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy. All welcome. </p>

Despite the significant benefits they offer, the development and adoption of PETs has been slow due to various factors. <br>
The ICO will be addressing some of the perceived barriers to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty as they release guidance on PETs later in 2021. As part of its work on enabling data sharing, the ICO is developing regulatory guidance and tools on anonymisation, pseudonymisation and PETs. The use of effective anonymisation techniques gives organisations the ability to share data more widely as anonymous information is outside the scope of data protection legislation. Their latest chapter of the anonymisation guidance, ‘How do we ensure anonymisation is effective?’, covers the critical topic of identifiability and what data protection law requires you to do when assessing whether your approach results in effective anonymisation.<br>
The team will discuss how data protection law applies where someone is ‘identified or identifiable’ and the concept of identifiability and how this is assessed in practice. Finally, it will discuss data protection in the context of PETs, including identifiability and key factors an organisation should consider. As part of the session, the team will also be running polls to gather audience opinion on key topics, for example, how the motivated intruder test can best be articulated for the future and our spectrum of identifiability approach.<br>
The CDEI will showcase the research it has done on PETs, the Centre’s understanding of policy and regulation issues, share our use case repository and walk through the adoption guide using an interactive case study exercise. The CDEI will also highlight the limitations of PETs and where they may not be a solution to privacy problems, with the aim to cut through some of the hype around these technologies. The CDEI hopes to crowdsource key problem areas where PETs are a compelling solution and build fruitful relationships with government stakeholders which could lead to future collaboration on projects demonstrating the value of PETs.</p>
