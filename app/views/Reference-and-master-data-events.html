RDMF’s mission is to provide high quality reference data about people, businesses, taxonomies and locations for government organisations, to enable better analysis and statistical outputs for the public good. RDMF will be available for cross-government use as part of the Integrated Data Service.<br>In the session Beata Lisowska Head of Data Products at ONS and her team will show and explain: how the Reference Data Management Framework is designed and structured; practical examples of how RDMF can be used to enhance analysis and the current state and the future vision for the index matching service.</p>

<h2>Tuesday - </h2><h2><div id="Tuesday-9-30am-to-11-00am-Practical-experiences-in-connecting-government-data">9:30am to 11:00am Practical experiences in connecting government data</div></h2><p>Description: In this session Swirrl will explain why it’s useful to make data more connectable and what people are trying to achieve. Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources. We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy. All welcome. </p>
