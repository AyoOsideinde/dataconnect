But where do we go from here?</p>
<p>One of the opportunities in the National Data Strategy is a new cross-government Data Management Community.</p>
<p>We know there are many people working on data management across government and the public sector. And there are many different data communities. We’re interested in finding out if these communities are providing you with the support you need? Are they embedding silos across government or breaking them down? Are there gaps? What even IS data management anyway? </p>
<p>This session is open to anyone who is working on data management, even if it’s not your ‘official’ job title.</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at the following question:<br>
<ul><li>What’s the challenge with bringing people together around data management, and is a cross-government community a good solution? </li></ul></p>
<p>Additional questions:<br>
<ul><li>How would a new cross-gov data management community add value to your work?</li>
<li>How would a cross-gov data management community collaborate with existing data communities and networks inside and outside of government? </li>
<li>How do we make sure the people who need it most can be a part of it? </li></ul><br>

Working closely with ministers, as one government, our shared focus on these priorities will enable us to achieve our vision of A Modern Civil Service that is more skilled, innovative and ambitious.</p>
<p>We believe there’s huge potential to use data better in government, strengthening staff tools, saving taxpayers’ money and improving outcomes for citizens.</p>
<p>This sounds all well and good, but what does it mean for you? In this plenary, led by the Modernisation and Reform Unit, we focus on the action government is taking to drive digital and data innovation. You will hear about some of the key projects and programmes taking<br>
place across government. You'll learn what they look like on the ground and how they will make a difference to your working life.</p>
<p>You will meet Modernisation and Reform Champions from the data community. And hear more about why they have joined the Champions network, what they are doing to make a difference, and why you should sign-up!</p>
<p>With the opportunity to ask questions at the end, you’ll come away from this workshop as excited and inspired by our vision for A Modern Civil Service as we are!</p>

Centre for Net Zero was set up to find faster, fairer, and more affordable ways to get there.</p>
<p>Centre for Net Zero is building the world’s most advanced, openly accessible agent-based model (ABM) of the energy transition, which will be launched in Autumn 2021. It will enable us to understand how people adopt and use low carbon technologies — like heat pumps and electric vehicles — both now and in the future. We’re able to build this simulation on the basis of the increasing availability of data on the adoption of these technologies. We’ve done a lot of work digging into the data, and we want to share what we’ve found so far in our Home Decarbonisation Index. It estimates how many kilograms of CO2 are now being saved by the installation of these technologies over the past decade, and ranks all UK local authorities from best to worst savers of CO2. </p>
<p>Whilst there’s more data out there than ever before regarding the adoption of low-carbon technologies, it isn’t easy to discover for most people. It’s often buried in endless government datasets and sometimes formatted for print instead of for analysts (e.g. the title of the table in the first row instead of field names). Different teams are responsible for reporting, so getting close to a complete picture requires a lot of legwork.</p>
<p>We wanted to bring the data about low-carbon technologies together in one place, which has been a pleasure to do, but it brought up two questions that we’d like to discuss with the DDaT and GSS data science professional communities that work with BEIS, DfT, MLUHC, and others that work across the energy, transport, and buildings sectors:</p>
<p>- As an open research lab, we want to use the most accessible technologies to share data with government, our partners, the private sector, and the third sector. We’ve placed a CSV file for download, but what would you prefer? More CSV? APIs? Just better metadata?</p>
<p> - We know that the way that the data is presented gives (too much?) credit to places with the lowest barriers to acquiring low-carbon technologies. Examples include places where residential density is low, few people live in flats and more people own their own home and vehicle. How could we present the data in a way that calculates and accounts for these barriers? Even better, can we account for lower-carbon intensive lifestyles ‘built-in’ to places with higher residential density and lower personal car use?</p>

As part of this review, we would like to speak with colleagues across public sector organisations to determine:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>what collaborations they have had/have with these kinds of organisations (with a focus on using collaborations to increase data science capability)</li>
<li>the successes and /or failures of these collaborations</li>
<li>whether they would be interested in utilising our collaborative agreements to increase data science capability within their organisations</li>
<li>how collaborative agreements can be used to increase data science capability across the public sector</li></ul></p>
<p>We would also like to hear from organisations outside of the public sector with regards to their experiences of collaborating to increase data science capability and are also keen to hear from organisations that are interested in collaborating with us.</p>

<p>Drawing from over 32 HMG, commercial and open sources, the data and analytical capability delivered by the Border Flow Service is used to respond to emerging issues, in real-time, at the border including emergencies and changing trends, with agility.</p>
<p>This will be an opportunity to share the X-HMG use case for such a service, the data sharing challenges the team overcame, the technology underpinning it and future evolutions of the service.</p>
<p>Format: Show and Tell</p>
<p>Audience: This session would be of interest to data analysts and strategic management who are looking to ensure data quality, consistency and practical application of good data governance principles.</p>
