Empowering analysts to consider the ethics of their work: A case study of the UK Statistics Authority’s data ethics framework <br>

<b>Short description</b><br>
Ensuring use of data in ethically appropriate ways is an important enabler for realising the potential to use data for public good research and statistics. The UK Statistics Authority has developed a framework and portfolio of services to empower analysts to consider the ethics of their research quickly and easily, at the research design phase.

Are you ready to 'follow the data'? Assessing data maturity in government<br>
<br>
<b>Short description</b><br>
Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models[<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality] provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed.

<br>
This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.<br>
