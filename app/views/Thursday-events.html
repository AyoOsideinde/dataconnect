Use the cross-government API Catalogue to source useful APIs and build stuff with real data. As much fun as building with a well known toy brick with a name derived from the Danish phrase “leg godt”.</p>
<p>Developers and product teams inside and outside of the public sector are very welcome - why not enter a team with your friends or colleagues. Some knowledge of developing products using APIs would definitely enhance your experience. </p>

Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality) provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed.

Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </a></p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>
