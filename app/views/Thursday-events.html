<p>It states, “We will look beyond London to all corners of the UK, as part of our mission to be a government more like the country we serve. More civil servants, including senior leaders, will work outside of the capital, joining the many dedicated front line staff already based in towns and cities across the UK.”</p>
<p>Therefore, a key action for 2021 is to implement plans to move 22,000 roles out of London by 2030, including 50% of Senior Civil Servant (SCS) roles, confirming at least five major departmental relocations this year.</p>
<p>As part of the GDS and Central Digital and Data Office location strategy, many new roles will be created in Manchester and Bristol, across a range of professions and capabilities, for the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>This session from Manchester Digital will discuss the current digital and data skills picture in Manchester and the UK, the challenges employers can overcome, and the initiatives that can be used to recruit and retain UK wide digital, data and technology specialists.</p>

Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)</a><br>
provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>

We have tracked value for money decisions and supporting evaluations by mapping geospatial data at a granular level – a relatively nascent endeavour within the Organisation – and have relied heavily on usually disparate data sources of varying quality which have been captured by Local Authorities of differing capacity and by private sector organisations. </p>
<p>We will present a case study from our cycling data insights project, which aimed to develop our understanding of the current data landscape and demonstrate the utility of data in government. As part of this project, we developed an experimental, proof-of-concept dashboard as a means of visualising the extent of cycling data maturity in Local Authorities, so as to enhance our understanding of cycling investment and its impact. </p>
<p>This session is for the benefit of government colleagues and will include a showcase of the dashboard and a discussion of how we used data when assembling our visualisations. </p>

It's also sometimes unclear how public procurement deals have been reached. This can be accidental, due to the huge complexities of ownership laws and contractual administration, or it can be deliberate, allowing bad actors to benefit in ways they shouldn't be.<br>
Either way, it's often difficult to know the truth of beneficial ownership from publicly available records, and improving transparency is emerging as an important tool for combating corruption, stemming illicit financial flows, and fighting tax evasion.  <br>
In this session, you'll hear from experts in CDDO's Data Standards Authority, Open Government at the Cabinet Office and Open Ownership to learn about our work in introducing a data standard for beneficial ownership across government.<br>
You'll find out about the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard itself, its use cases, the team's pathway to developing it for wider use, and the government's wider commitment to transparency in the context of the National Action Plan.<br>

<p>Rebecca Leader is the Data Transformation Lead for the Supporting Families Programme in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Her role is focused on improving the use of data, systems and analytics in local authority partnerships to help support families through the identification and prevention of multiple and complex issues. She has worked to develop tools to provide a framework for data maturity, allow local authorities to assess their own maturity in this field and monitor national progress. Her approach is to equip local authorities to build solid foundations and systems on which robust analytics can be applied. Rebecca has worked in a police force on research and strategy planning, led data teams in a local authority across Supporting Families and Early Help, Youth Offending, Childrens Services.

We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.</p>
<p>We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.</p>
<p>In this session we will discuss:<ul><br>
<li>- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations</li>
<li>- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions</li>
<li>- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise</li>
</ul></p>
<p>This session will be followed by a hands on implementation workshop on Friday: <a href="https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-">https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-</a><br>
