<p>It states, “We will look beyond London to all corners of the UK, as part of our mission to be a government more like the country we serve. More civil servants, including senior leaders, will work outside of the capital, joining the many dedicated front line staff already based in towns and cities across the UK.”</p>
<p>Therefore, a key action for 2021 is to implement plans to move 22,000 roles out of London by 2030, including 50% of Senior Civil Servant (SCS) roles, confirming at least five major departmental relocations this year.</p>
<p>As part of the GDS and Central Digital and Data Office location strategy, many new roles will be created in Manchester and Bristol, across a range of professions and capabilities, for the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>This session from Manchester Digital will discuss the current digital and data skills picture in Manchester and the UK, the challenges employers can overcome, and the initiatives that can be used to recruit and retain UK wide digital, data and technology specialists.</p>

Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality) provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed.

Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </a></p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>
