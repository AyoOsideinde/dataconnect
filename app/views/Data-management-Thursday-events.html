Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)</a><br>
provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>

Rebecca Leader is the Data Transformation Lead for the Supporting Families Programme in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Her role is focused on improving the use of data, systems and analytics in local authority partnerships to help support families through the identification and prevention of multiple and complex issues. She has worked to develop tools to provide a framework for data maturity, allow local authorities to assess their own maturity in this field and monitor national progress. Her approach is to equip local authorities to build solid foundations and systems on which robust analytics can be applied. Rebecca has worked in a police force on research and strategy planning, led data teams in a local authority across Supporting Families and Early Help, Youth Offending, Childrens Services. She has been in the national team since 2018..</p>

We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.<br>
We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.<br>
In this session we will discuss:<br>
- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations<br>
- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions<br>
- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise<br>
This session will be followed by a hands on implementation workshop on Friday: <a href="https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-">https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-</a><br>
