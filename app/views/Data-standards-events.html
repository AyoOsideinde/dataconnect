Data can help the government deliver services that are suited to the individual needs of citizens, with wide-reaching effects.<br>But achieving this has to be a collaboration. We all have to work together to drive data-enabled transformation for everyone.<br>Join the senior leaders of GDS and CDDO as they discuss how we are approaching these challenges.

Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources. We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy. All welcome. </p>

<h2>Wednesday - </h2><h2><div id="Wednesday-10-00am-to-10-45am-Improving-coherence-of-government-statistics">10:00am to 10:45am Improving coherence of government statistics</div></h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of providing the public with coherent and accessible statistics where there are multiple producers. As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.</p>
<p>Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy. The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.</p>
<p>This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.</p>

Drawing on principles from the soon to be published Data Sharing Governance Framework, we set out what a cross-government standardised and coordinated approach to the non-technical elements of data sharing can fix, what change looks like over time and how the not-so-usual suspects can support faster and easier data sharing.</p>
