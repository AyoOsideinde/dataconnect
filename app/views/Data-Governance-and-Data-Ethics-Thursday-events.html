The UK Statistics Authority has developed a framework and portfolio of services to empower analysts to consider the ethics of their research quickly and easily, at the research design phase. This session will provide an overview of this framework and accompanying user support services. </p>

Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)</a><br>
provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>

We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.<br>
We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.<br>
In this session we will discuss:<br>
- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations<br>
- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions<br>
- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise<br>
This session will be followed by a hands on implementation workshop on Friday: <a href="https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-">https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-</a><br>
