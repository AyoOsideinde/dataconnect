<h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

A joint session from Public Health England and Joint Biosecurity Centre on two innovations in collection, sharing and using public health data.<br>Joint Biosecurity Centre: The pandemic has uncovered the need - and potential - for novel, non-traditional health data to inform the health protection response. A limitation of translating non-health data in public health action is determining the most relevant level of geography. In the UK, the administrative and statistical building blocks coincide at the Local Authority level. However, Local Authority boundaries do not necessarily capture the way communities actually live and work. We have been looking at alternative ways to aggregate data to address this problem. This will be illustrated through the case of Wastewater monitoring.<br>Public Health England: The UK coronavirus dashboard is the government source of data on the pandemic and is praised by national and international bodies, including the Prime Minister, Health Secretary, National Statistician, and members of the public for its comprehensiveness, integrity, and agility. The talk will look at how PHE have produced the dashboard, with a particular focus on the use of APIs.</p>

The DQHub would like to invite you to an interactive workshop to explore current practices, challenges, and solutions to assessing data quality. We will cover all stages of analysis, including: understanding your needs, assessing quality, cleaning data, and much more.   </p>
<p>Join us to share and learn from others on how to make sure that your data is fit for purpose!  </p>
<p>Format: Workshop<br>Speakers: Lucia Barbone and Kathryn Reynold, Government Data Quality Hub. Lucia is an economic adviser, data analysis specialist, and data quality passionate. She focuses on supporting analysts and leaders in understanding and improving the quality of their data, from both a technical and strategic perspective. Kathryn is a data specialist with experience working in the public and non-profit sectors. She is passionate about ensuring that data can deliver real impacts for real people and working towards improving data quality in government to enable this. She is currently developing frameworks and guidance to support this mission. <br>Connect: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-data-quality-hub">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-data-quality-hub</a><br>Date and time: Wednesday 29th September, 11:00am to 12:00pm<br>Length of session: 60 minutes<br> Registration link: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/no-1-quality-street-what-all-analysts-need-to-know-about-data-quality-tickets-170019106725">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/no-1-quality-street-what-all-analysts-need-to-know-about-data-quality-tickets-170019106725</a></p>

Data science mentors provide advice and guidance to help a colleague develop technical skills through working on an analytical project. From a knotty technical question or new insight from their mentees’ data, to a different approach to project management or simply a new way of using Github, mentors report that they gain new skills and knowledge through mentoring others. It also provides opportunities their current role may not, such as demonstrating and developing skills like coaching, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>If you would like to share your data science skills and knowledge, learning yourself while helping others grow, there is a range of mentoring opportunities available at various skill levels. This session will provide an in-depth look at the data science mentoring movement and how you can be a part of it. It will provide more information on what’s involved, the programmes available and the support provided. There will also be an opportunity to put your questions to a panel of experienced data science mentors.</p>
