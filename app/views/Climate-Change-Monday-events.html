<h2><div id="Monday-3-00pm-to-4-00pm-Near-real-time-use-of-publicly-available-Environment-Agency-data">3:00pm to 4:00pm Near real time use of publicly available Environment Agency data</div></h2><p>The Environment Agency is classed as a First responder and as such it is vital that the data they get is as near real time as is possible, especially when citizensâ€™ lives and livelihoods depend on it. </p>
<p>With the climate emergency looming, sea-levels are rising, the weather is becoming more extreme and erratic, so a real-world example would be the ever-increasing threat of flooding. In the UK Met Office records show that 9 of the 17 record-breaking rainfall months or seasons since 1910 have occurred within the last 20 years. </p>
<p>Chris Hansford will talk us through how the use of publicly available data can be used to help alert, warn and protect us from these catastrophic weather events. All welcome.</p>
