We will explain the multitude of ways in which the Environment Agency represents Place data, how this has been conceptually modelled and how this will be used to improve our data.<br>You don't need to be a data modelling expert to join this presentation - Becky and Sarah's presentation is a fantastic introduction to the benefits of using data modelling to solve sticky challenges in your data. <br>This session is brought to you by the GDAC Data Modelling community of practice.<br>
