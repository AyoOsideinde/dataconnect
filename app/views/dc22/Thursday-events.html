Increasingly a large amount of the data ONS handles is sourced externally from other public, private and third-sector organisations, and to acquire this huge sum of data ONS needs to work directly with hundreds of organisations and manage thousands of individual data flows. With the need for data ever growing ONS has turned to automation tools to drive efficiency, utilising the latest technology and business processes to enable the organisation to realise its ambitions as the centre of UK data science and big data analysis.<br>This session will provide a non-technical overview of ONS’ brand-new data acquisition pipeline, the improvements it will bring and the importance of building modern and scalable business processes to make sure that you get the right input, from the right people at the right time.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session lead:</b> Matt Brown, Office for National Statistics<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/automation-how-ons-built-a-modern-scalable-data-acquisition-pipeline-tickets-418610734977">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-418610734977"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '418610734977',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-418610734977',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=10:00am-to-11:00am-Data-Quality-Action-Plans---Workshop-2>10:00am to 11:00am Data Quality Action Plans - Workshop 2</h2><p><p>This workshop will provide focused support to help you take the first steps in creating a Data Quality Action Plan for a dataset in your organisation.

Public bodies that serve the people of Wales are required to provide services in Welsh and English. Public bodies cannot, currently, provide digital mapping services in Welsh. It is not possible, for example, to obtain Welsh-language tiles from the Ordnance Survey. Official sources of Welsh names for places and features are far from comprehensive and using alternative sources can be complex in technical and policy terms.</p><p>Mapio Cymru is a project hosted by Data Orchard CIC that has aimed to highlight and solve the problem of the empty maps.

This is achieved by matching survey and census responses to the UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (SIC) and Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) frameworks. Unfortunately, existing matching tools only automate a small fraction of typical responses, and require large and expensive clerical teams to match the remainder. To make matters worse, there is currently no centralised standard for performing this matching, leading to inefficiencies and incompatibilities between data sets. </p><p>The Classifications team has been working hard to remedy this, producing an innovative, one-stop tool to be a core part of the Reference Data Management Framework and cross-government Integrated Data Service. Our journey has thoroughly investigated existing tools, testing their limitations and exploring new ideas. Join us as we show you how our findings led us to combined the best parts of deterministic and machine learning techniques to create a distributed, automated, world-leading hybrid tool ideally suited to the new data-rich digital world.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentations plus Q&A<br><b>Session leads:</b> Alex Howard, Lucy Fergusson and Suzanne Fry.
