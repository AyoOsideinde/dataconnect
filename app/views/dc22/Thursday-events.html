<p><h2>Thursday</h2></p><h2>10.00am to 11.00am Data Quality Action Plans - Workshop 2</h2><p><p>This workshop will provide focused support to help you take the first steps in creating a Data Quality Action Plan for a dataset in your organisation. It is an interactive workshop session so please come with a dataset in mind.</p><p>Ideally, you should have attended Monday's session introducing the Data Quality Action Plan approach, or completed the <a href="https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans">Data Quality Action Plans E-Learning</a> to get the most from this session.</p><p>Attendees will be limited to just three people so we can provide the best support. Please sign up to only one workshop session in the week, this is a single, one-hour session rather than a course of sessions.</p><p>If you'd like this workshop run for your team, please email dqhub@ons.gov.uk</p><p><b>Format:</b> Interactive workshop<br><b>Session lead:</b> Rebecca Strickland, Government Data Quality Hub<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <br><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework">Government Data Quality Framework</a><br><a href="https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_data_quality_assessments">Introduction to Data Quality Assessments E-Learning</a><br><a href="https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans">Data Quality Action Plans E-Learning</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-quality-action-plans-workshop-2-tickets-391053209677">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-391053209677"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '391053209677',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-391053209677',});</script><h2>10:30am to 11:00am Data at your fingertips</h2><p><p>Come and join our Integrated Data Service (IDS) team as they give an overview of the IDS vision and what it means for the future of deidentified data sharing and collaborative analysis in the UK.</p><p>The Integrated Data Service (IDS) is a new cross-government initiative which has been designed to transform the way de-identified data about our society and economy is made available for vital research and decision making in the UK. The service is open to analysts within government, the Devolved Administrations and external accredited researchers, allowing them to carry out analysis that addresses major societal challenges.</p><p>The service is a key enabler of the Government’s National Data Strategy and Modernisation agenda, and will provide improved forms of data, alongside analytical and visualisation tools, in a secure multi-cloud infrastructure. The service also supports the governments ambition of transforming for a digital future from 2022 and beyond.</p><p>We will be covering several key areas during the session, including our mission and the benefits the IDS will offer.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session lead:</b> Dominic Hale, Head of Strategy, Integrated Data Programme<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> http://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-at-your-fingertips-tickets-400626493627">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-400626493627"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '400626493627',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-400626493627',});</script><h2>11.00am to 12.00pm The empty maps of Wales</h2><p><p>Welsh is an official language in the UK. Public bodies that serve the people of Wales are required to provide services in Welsh and English. Public bodies cannot, currently, provide digital mapping services in Welsh. It is not possible, for example, to obtain Welsh-language tiles from the Ordnance Survey. Official sources of Welsh names for places and features are far from comprehensive and using alternative sources can be complex in technical and policy terms.</p><p>Mapio Cymru is a project hosted by Data Orchard CIC that has aimed to highlight and solve the problem of the empty maps. The project provides a full set of mapping tiles covering Wales using only Welsh-language data (from OpenStreetMap and Wikidata) and works with public bodies to help them solve the problem of empty maps.</p><p>In this presentation Mapio Cymru will talk about the problem, why it matters, what has been done to address it so far and what more public bodies could do to address it in the future.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Carl Morris, Ben Proctor and David Wyn Williams from Mapio Cymru<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <br><a href="https://openstreetmap.cymru">View the map</a><br><a href="https://mapio.cymru/en/">View the project site</a><br><a href="https://mapio.cymru/en/2022/05/sut-mae-mapio-yn-y-gymraeg/">A post on the state of Welsh-language mapping</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-empty-maps-of-wales-tickets-394256841827">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-394256841827"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '394256841827',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-394256841827',});</script><h2>1pm to 1:45pm Asking the right questions: A conversation toolkit for administrative data</h2><p><p>Do you use administrative data to produce statistics?</p><p>If so, join us to find out about a toolkit ONS researchers are developing that could help you.</p><p>The Office for Statistics Regulation state the importance of statistical producers communicating with their admin data supply partners to help understand the data they are using. It is advised that this communication should be on-going to ensure producers are aware of and consider any impacts of changes to datasets. </p><p>To support these vital conversations, we are developing a conversation toolkit which will consist of: <br><ul><li>a comprehensive question bank</li><li>a conversation template</li><li>guidance for communicating with supply partners </li></ul><br>Join our show and tell session to find out more about the toolkit, to provide your feedback and to help inform its design.</p><p>The toolkit that they are developing seeks to support implementation of specific aspects of the guidance on Quality Assurance of Administrative Data, as set out by the Office for Statistics Regulation, and the Administrative Data Quality Framework which is currently being developed by their colleagues at ONS.</p><p>Kim is an Assistant Methodologist and Jenny is a Senior Researcher and Qualitative Specialist based in the Methodological Research Hub at ONS.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Show and tell<br><b>Session leads:</b> Kim Warne and Jenny Knight<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <br><a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/">Quality Assurance of Administrative Data</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/asking-the-right-questions-a-conversation-toolkit-for-administrative-data-tickets-401158003387">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-401158003387"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '401158003387',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-401158003387',});</script><h2>2.00pm to 3.00pm A day in the life of a Research Ethics Committee</h2><p><p>Have you ever wondered what research ethics committees REALLY do, and what it is they consider when they look at different research projects?</p><p>Join us for an interactive session where you will become a member of an ethics panel, working through the different ethical issues associated with a research project. How will you support the researchers to go ahead with their plans? Or perhaps it’s just too much of a risk? You decide!</p><p>The workshop will help you to better understand what we – the UK Statistics Authority’s data ethics team (at the Centre for Applied Data Ethics) - and the National Statistician’s Data Ethics Advisory Committee consider when looking at research projects for the first time.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Interactive workshop<br><b>Session lead:</b> The Centre for Applied Data Ethics<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <br><a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/what-we-do/data-ethics/centre-for-applied-data-ethics/">Centre for Applied Data Ethics – UK Statistics Authority</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-research-ethics-committee-tickets-393036912987">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-393036912987"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '393036912987',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-393036912987',});</script>
