<p><h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Friday</h2></p><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=9:00am-to-9:30am-Dtechtive:-Harnessing-technological-solutions-to-aid-data-discoverability>9:00am to 9:30am Dtechtive: Harnessing technological solutions to aid data discoverability</h2><p><p>Scottish Government are running a <a href="https://www.civtech.scot/">CivTech</a> project looking at how technology can help improving public sector data discoverability. The aim of the project is to help people find data using simple search terms without needing to know the specific name of the data, who owns it and where it might be published. We are working in partnership with a company called <a href="https://dtime.ai/">Dtime</a> to develop a solution nicknamed ‘Dtechtive’. Dtechtive will allow people to search for and discover public sector open data but it will also provide data owners with feedback on what people are searching for and if they are finding data relevant to this. Dtechtive will also be available as an API that can integrate with any existing web, desktop, mobile or enterprise applications.</p><p>If you would like to hear more, please come along to hear us talk through the project in more detail.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Speakers:</b> Shona Nicol and Gautham Krishnadas <br><b>Session Resources:</b><br><a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2021/06/23/finding-public-sector-data/">Digital Finding public sector data</a><br><a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2021/11/24/civtech-6-challenge-12-update/">Digital CivTech 6 - Challenge 12 update</a><br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup Link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dtechtive-harnessing-technological-solutions-to-aid-data-discoverability-tickets-414522406677">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-414522406677"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '414522406677',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-414522406677',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=10:00am-to-10:30am-Data-on-a-Roll:-What-we-learned-from-rewriting-our-data-strategy>10:00am to 10:30am Data on a Roll: What we learned from rewriting our data strategy</h2><p><p> The ONS is the UK’s largest independent producer of official statistics.

This model will be taken forward by the Central Digital & Data Office in Cabinet Office, and rolled out across government.</p><p>This session will take you on a tour of the model, looking at its structure and how different aspects of data maturity are reflected. There won’t be time to look at everything but it will give you a n overview and a better idea of how it works in practice.</p><p>This is one of four sessions across the week that feature the Data Maturity Model.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Show & tell with time for questions<br><b>Session lead:</b> Matt Thompson, Government Data Quality Hub<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-government-data-maturity-model-meet-the-model-tickets-390606082307">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390606082307"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390606082307',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390606082307',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=1:00pm-to-1:30pm-Data-sharing-legal-gateways:-Digital-Economy-Act-(2017)>1:00pm to 1:30pm Data sharing legal gateways: Digital Economy Act (2017)</h2><p><p>Join Patrick Kiernan from the Central Digital and Data Office.</p><p>This session will introduce the data sharing powers that are enabled by part 5 of the Digital Economy Act (2017), how these powers are currently being used, and the plans to add new legal gateways.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session Lead:</b> Patrick Kiernan<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-sharing-legal-gateways-digital-economy-act-2017-tickets-421255264837">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-421255264837"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '421255264837',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-421255264837',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=1:00pm-to-1:45pm-Mind-your-literacy>1:00pm to 1:45pm Mind your literacy</h2><p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted as never before the value and importance of data. It also highlighted the patchy quality of data in organisations and the need to improve their data practices and expand data use. Success in this is only really possible if organisations take data transformation seriously. In the public sector, lack of knowledge, resource and budget are all challenges to achieving this.<br>One of the most crucial issues is the need to encourage organisations to develop a data culture and implement a data literacy programme for their workforce . Without these actions, it will be much harder to achieve the transformational change needed for public data. Whilst data professionals understand data’s potential, the wider workforce have yet to fully understand data and its central role for their work.<br>This session will be a  round table discussion about the challenges of and plans to address data literacy needs, This is a fascinating topic which is at the forefront of data transformation, inviting innovative thinking and fresh learning approaches.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Roundtable<br><b>Speaker/s:</b> Claudia Lundie (Home Office), Sally Kerr (Scottish Government) and Lisa Allen (ODI)<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup Link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/423445134797">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-423445134797"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '423445134797',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-423445134797',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=1:00pm-to-1:45pm-Quality-in=Quality-Out:-Qualitative-methods-to-improve-your-data-quality>1:00pm to 1:45pm Quality in=Quality Out: Qualitative methods to improve your data quality</h2><p><p>Have you ever wanted to know how qualitative methods can improve your data quality? Or wanted to know how in-depth qualitative insights can inform decision making for quantitative data collection? <br>Qualitative research involves the collection and analysis of non-numerical data. It provides us with detailed insights into people’s experiences, beliefs and opinions. It can help us better understand why people behave the way they do and improve the services we provide. <br>In this session we introduce qualitative data collection methodologies and how these can be applied to ensure data being collected and the outputs being produced are of high-quality.  <br>We will also discuss ethical considerations in qualitative data collection and some mitigations for this. This will include a brief overview of our guidance published earlier this year.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation with time for questions<br><b>Session leads</b>: Becky Fry & Alice Toms, Office for National Statistics<br><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/ethical-considerations-associated-with-qualitative-research-methods/pages/1/">Ethical Considerations associated with Qualitative Research methods</a><br><b>Open to:</b> All<br>Signup Link: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/quality-inquality-out-qualitative-methods-to-improve-your-data-quality-tickets-414526198017">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-414526198017"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '414526198017',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-414526198017',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=2:00pm-to-2:30pm-CoffeeConnect:-Session-3>2:00pm to 2:30pm CoffeeConnect: Session 3</h2><p><p>Join us for a coffee roulette session to connect and network with fellow attendees.
