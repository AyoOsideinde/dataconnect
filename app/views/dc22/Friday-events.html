This model will be taken forward by the Central Digital & Data Office in Cabinet Office, and rolled out across government.</p><p>This session will take you on a tour of the model, looking at its structure and how different aspects of data maturity are reflected. There won’t be time to look at everything but it will give you a n overview and a better idea of how it works in practice.</p><p>This is one of four sessions across the week that feature the Data Maturity Model.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation with time for questions<br><b>Session lead:</b> Matt Thompson, Government Data Quality Hub<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> http://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-government-data-maturity-model-meet-the-model-tickets-390606082307">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390606082307"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390606082307',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390606082307',});</script><h2 id=2:00pm-to-2:30pm-CoffeeConnect:-Session-3>2:00pm to 2:30pm CoffeeConnect: Session 3</h2><p><p>Join us for a coffee roulette session to connect and network with fellow attendees.
