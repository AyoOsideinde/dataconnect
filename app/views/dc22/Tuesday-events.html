When constructed, the research-ready data collection will provide an invaluable resource to enable research, which will help to inform policy debate and decision making, helping to improve prosperity, resilience, and well-being in this sector.</p> <p> The data collection brings together information about individuals working and living on farms – including census, education, and health data – alongside information about farm businesses – including data about farming activities, income, and geographical information. In order to create such a comprehensive data collection for all of the UK, we have been working across government departments and agencies to make sure we have comprehensive and comparable coverage of these areas. Alongside this we are working closely with data owners, processors, and researchers to make sure that the data being produced by this process across the four nations meets expectations.</p><p> Whilst the collection will enable research in a number of important areas of policy, our presentation focuses on the work before this – how we have gone about bringing these data together, and how we have worked across different national data and policy landscapes, as we discuss some of the challenges, successes and opportunities that the project has encountered. As well as offering information about the data itself, we hope that the presentation can provide valuable insight into this kind of pan-UK working, with discussion of lessons learned and ways of working developed.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Jen Hampton (Office for National Statistics) & Nicholas Webster (ADR Wales, Wales Government)<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <a href="https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/administrative-data-agricultural-research-collection-enhancing-the-prosperity-and-wellbeing-of-farm-households-293/">Administrative Data | Agricultural Research Collection</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/adarc-bringing-together-data-to-understand-farms-and-farming-households-tickets-411175485947">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-411175485947"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '411175485947',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-411175485947',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=10:00am-to-11:00am-The-Government-Data-Maturity-Model:-Assessing-Maturity>10:00am to 11:00am The Government Data Maturity Model: Assessing Maturity</h2><p><p>In order to deliver the ambitions of the National Data Strategy, we need to understand how well government organisations are approaching data and data management.</p><p>Over the past two years, the Government Data Quality Hub has been developing and testing a maturity model that will help organisations to assess themselves, then identify changes that will help them improve their data maturity. This model will be taken forward by the Central Digital & Data Office in Cabinet Office, and rolled out across government.</p><p>The model was tested by 11 organisations during its development. This session will look at the experience of one of those organisations. Find out what worked, what didn’t, what they learned about their data maturity and why it matters.</p><p>This is one of four sessions across the week that feature the Data Maturity Model.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Conversation with time for questions<br><b>Session leads:</b> Michal Poreba (Department for International Trade) & Matt Thompson (Government Data Quality Hub)<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-government-data-maturity-model-assessing-maturity-tickets-390599643047">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390599643047"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390599643047',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390599643047',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=11:00am-to-11:30am-Geospatial-data-standards:-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter?>11:00am to 11:30am Geospatial data standards: what are they and why do they matter?</h2><p><p>Hear from Ordnance Survey’s geospatial data standards lead Allan Jamieson on what standards are, what they do, how they work and why we should all be spending a little bit more time getting to know why they matter.</p><p>Geospatial data standards are much more than just technical documents to implement, although they do perform that important function, they are the glue that helps to integrate all types of geospatial data.</p><p>Standards are key to making geospatial data Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), and they also represent our willingness to collaborate internationally, improving the consistency in the delivery of geospatial data and services, improving outcomes and enhancing value for money.</p><p>This session will include an introduction to the recently launched National Geospatial Data Standards Register, a collaboration between the Geospatial Commission (Cabinet Office), the BSI standards committee on geographic information, and Ordnance Survey.</p><p>This session is suitable for all professionals and practitioners working with, or wanting to work with geographic information.

Only by systematically gathering and managing data about their data (that is, metadata), can they confidently aspire to be data driven institutions.</p><p>As the Data Products team in the Government Digital Service, we have been striving to enrich the content on GOV.UK with semantic metadata to improve the machine readability of the site. This will act as an enabler for more advanced analytical techniques and applications, like improved information findability, content auditing, question answering and content recommendations, which will ultimately benefit internal colleagues and GOV.UK end-users as a result.</p><p>In this session, we will discuss how we have leveraged a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique known as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and pre-trained language models, like BERT and RoBERTa, to extract essential metadata from the site. We will share the journey of the project, including experiences of building a business case, creating training data and schema, fine-tuning deep learning models, agile collaboration and development, challenges and lessons learned, and ideas for next steps.</p><p>We hope this will spark a conversation with teams in other organisations who are working on similar projects.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Alessia Tosi, Rory Hurley, Mohamed Abdisalam<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/govner-enriching-govuk-metadata-with-natural-language-processing-tickets-415413883107">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-415413883107"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '415413883107',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-415413883107',});</script>
