This model will be taken forward by the Central Digital & Data Office in Cabinet Office, and rolled out across government.</p><p>This session will cover the maturity model project, how the model itself was tested and what the key findings were, plus what’s next for the maturity model in government.</p><p>This is one of four sessions across the week that feature the Data Maturity Model.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation with time for questions<br><b>Session leads:</b> Daniel Hesse, Rebecca Strickland & Matt Thompson<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-government-data-maturity-model-where-has-it-come-from-whats-next-tickets-390587647167">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390587647167"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390587647167',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390587647167',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=1:00pm-to-2:00pm-Data-Quality-Action-Plans>1:00pm to 2:00pm Data Quality Action Plans</h2><p><p>We need to know whether our data is fit for purpose. But it isn't always easy to know what make data fit for purpose, or to know how to fix quality problems when you find them. Data Quality Action Plans can help!</p> <p>This session is aimed at anyone interested in understanding quality as part of data management.</p><p>This session is back after it was first run at DataConnect 21. We will be running small workshops later in the week for people who would like to talk through the steps in creating their own Data Quality Action Plans.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation with time for questions<br><b>Session lead:</b> Rebecca Strickland<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> E-learning courses:<br><a href="https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_data_quality_assessments">Introduction to Data Quality Assessments</a><br><a href="https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans/">Data Quality Action Plans</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-quality-action-plans-tickets-390607967947">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390607967947"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390607967947',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390607967947',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=2:00pm-to-3:00pm-Geoplace-and-Barnsley-Council-Best-practice-from-local-government:-Unleashing-Local-Authority-Data-–-Helping-the-Most-Vulnerable>2:00pm to 3:00pm Geoplace and Barnsley Council Best practice from local government: Unleashing Local Authority Data – Helping the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><p>Barnsley Council has been on a mission since 2019 to unlock the massive potential of its data. Local authorities collect significant amounts of valuable data about their citizens, communities and places. The age-old challenge is how do you get that data to a place where you can start making connections that will turn it into usable intelligence?</p><p>Come and listen to how Barnsley has built a data warehouse of over 500 tables of fully managed data, from dozens of legacy key line of business systems. How it adds value to that data by linking it together, at postcode, household and person level. How it is creating innovative solutions not just reports. And ultimately, how it identifies and helps the most vulnerable citizens.</p><p>The session will look at how Barnsley works, the low-cost, low-code tools it uses, how to connect data, and how it responds quickly to customer demands. There will be plenty of real-world examples, and the session will wrap-up by sharing what the council will be working on next.</p><p>This 60 minute session will provide an understanding on how local authorities utilise the UPRNs contained in AddressBase to connect data and reveal insights to better target service provision. It is aimed at people in the public sector who would like to attend a practical session focussing on data linking.</p><p>GeoPlace is wholly owned by the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. We work under contract with every local authority in England and Wales to support the management of their Local Land & Property Gazetteers (LLPGs) and Local Street Gazetteers (LSGs). AddressBase and the NSG are freely available to every public sector organisation under the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement. They are also mandated for use by central government as open standards to identify geographic locations.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Mark Wood, Business Intelligence Technical Advisor, Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and Luke Studden, Data Acquisition and Integration Manager, GeoPlace.<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/unleashing-local-authority-data-helping-the-most-vulnerable-tickets-386967739927">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-386967739927"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '386967739927',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-386967739927',});</script>
