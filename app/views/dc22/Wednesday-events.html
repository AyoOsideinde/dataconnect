The Commission is interested in why and how people gamble, how this differs across different segments of the population as well as how behaviour changes over time including those who experience harm from their gambling.</p><p>It also needs to understand the gambling opportunities available, how the market is evolving and what industry is doing. To do this the Commission gathers evidence from a range of data sources, and it is on a mission to improve the range and quality of the data it gathers.</p><p>The Commission will discuss the work it has been undertaking in one area to introduce a new Gambling Survey for Great Britain as well as its ambitions for the future including tracking behaviour changes over time through longitudinal research and exploring opportunities for data linkage.</p><p>We are really interested in hearing from people who may have experience of or are starting to link up about opportunities for data linkage.</p><p>The Gambling Commission is overseeing the development of the new Gambling Survey for Great Britain which will measure participation and the prevalence of problem gambling amongst adults in Great Britain.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation followed by Q&A<br><b>Session lead:</b> Helen Bryce, Head of Statistics in the Research and Statistics team at the Gambling Commission<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/statistics-and-research/">Releases of official statistics and research from the Gambling Commission</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/increasing-the-effective-use-of-the-data-by-the-gambling-commission-tickets-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile',});</script><h2 id=11.00am-to-11:45am-Geoplace-and-Local-Government-Association---Mission-3:-Transforming-for-a-digital-future:-a-roadmap-for-digital-and-data-with-land-and-property>11.00am to 11:45am Geoplace and Local Government Association - Mission 3: Transforming for a digital future: a roadmap for digital and data with land and property</h2><p><p>Data management is the most important part of modern government and its most intractable limitation. Public services are only as good as the data that powers them. A digital future needs a consistent, joined up evidence base to underpin decision making.</p><p>Access to authoritative and dynamically updated information about people, land and property, businesses and assets is essential for a government that is connected and engaged with addressing the wellbeing and resilience of people and place right across the UK.</p><p>Reducing duplication, automating manual processes, joining together disparate datasets to reveal insights will save billions of pounds, foster innovation and enable public services to be transformed to achieve the right outcomes.</p><p>This session will discuss the need for open standards and ‘key registers’ for critical data assets such as land and property information to support a cross-cutting, functional model for government. It will outline the value of a consistent, joined up evidence base to underpin all decisions around land and property, and service delivery to people at places. After all, everything happens somewhere.</p><p>This session is aimed at Chief Data Officers and the people responsible for delivering the government’s 2022-25 Roadmap for Digital and Data.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Nick Chapallaz, Managing Director, GeoPlace and Juliet Whitworth, Research and Information Manager, Local Government Association<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lga-and-geoplace-a-roadmap-for-digital-and-data-with-land-and-property-tickets-386999234127">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-386999234127"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '386999234127',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-386999234127',});</script><h2 id=12.00pm-to-12:55pm-Engineering-the-Country’s-PAYE-Data>12.00pm to 12:55pm Engineering the Country’s PAYE Data</h2><p><p>Our presentation will focus on using PAYE-RTI data at the Office for National Statistics.

This model will be taken forward by the Central Digital & Data Office in Cabinet Office, and rolled out across government.</p><p>Learn more about how using the data maturity model helps organisations achieve a wide range of strategic objectives and deliver better public services.</p><p>This is one of four sessions across the week that feature the Data Maturity Model. </p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation with time for questions<br><b>Session lead:</b> Dan Hesse, Central Digital & Data Office<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-government-data-maturity-model-strategic-drivers-tickets-390602973007">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-390602973007"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '390602973007',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-390602973007',});</script>
