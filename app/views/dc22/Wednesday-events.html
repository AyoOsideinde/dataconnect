The FAIR data principles are a framework for managing and publishing data to unlock its value for the whole data ecosystem. They aim of the principles is to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). FAIR was created by academics to support the research community, and this session will explore the potential for their use in the UK public sector. </p><p>The session will be a short presentation on the principles, followed by an open discussion to identify current use in government, and whether there are opportunities to incorporate them further. If you are currently using the principles, or if you would like to find out more about how they might be suitable for you, please do come along and be ready to discuss!</p><p><b>Please note this session is interactive and attendees will be expected to participate.</b></p><p><b>Format: </b>Presentation followed by open discussion<br><b>Speaker/s: </b>Kathryn Reynolds, Shona Nicol, Smerah Akbar<br><b>Session resources: </b> <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR Principles - GO FAIR</a><br><b>Date and time: </b>Day 28th September, 9:00am to 9:45am<br><b>Length of session: </b>45 minutes<br><b>Open to all? </b>Yes<br><b>Signup link: </b><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fair-data-from-principles-to-practice-how-uk-public-sector-can-use-fair-tickets-411872480677">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-411872480677"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '411872480677',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-411872480677',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=9:30am-to-10:15am-WaID---a-future-without-drowning>9:30am to 10:15am WaID - a future without drowning</h2><p><p>The Water Incident Dataset is a collaborative project involving data from emergency services, charities and open data brought together using graph technologies, and analysed to inform drowning prevention, with the ultimate aim to meet the government and World Health Organisation vision of a future without accidental drowning.

The Commission is interested in why and how people gamble, how this differs across different segments of the population as well as how behaviour changes over time including those who experience harm from their gambling.</p><p>It also needs to understand the gambling opportunities available, how the market is evolving and what industry is doing. To do this the Commission gathers evidence from a range of data sources, and it is on a mission to improve the range and quality of the data it gathers.</p><p>The Commission will discuss the work it has been undertaking in one area to introduce a new Gambling Survey for Great Britain as well as its ambitions for the future including tracking behaviour changes over time through longitudinal research and exploring opportunities for data linkage.</p><p>We are really interested in hearing from people who may have experience of or are starting to link up about opportunities for data linkage.</p><p>The Gambling Commission is overseeing the development of the new Gambling Survey for Great Britain which will measure participation and the prevalence of problem gambling amongst adults in Great Britain.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation followed by Q&A<br><b>Session lead:</b> Helen Bryce, Head of Statistics in the Research and Statistics team at the Gambling Commission<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Session resources:</b> <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/statistics-and-research/">Releases of official statistics and research from the Gambling Commission</a><br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/increasing-the-effective-use-of-the-data-by-the-gambling-commission-tickets-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-400218964697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=11:00am-to-11:55am-Migrating-GOV.UK-to-Google-Analytics-4>11:00am to 11:55am Migrating GOV.UK to Google Analytics 4</h2><p><p>During this session we will be discussing the GDS approach to the migration from Google Analytics Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4.

Public services are only as good as the data that powers them. A digital future needs a consistent, joined up evidence base to underpin decision making.</p><p>Access to authoritative and dynamically updated information about people, land and property, businesses and assets is essential for a government that is connected and engaged with addressing the wellbeing and resilience of people and place right across the UK.</p><p>Reducing duplication, automating manual processes, joining together disparate datasets to reveal insights will save billions of pounds, foster innovation and enable public services to be transformed to achieve the right outcomes.</p><p>This session will discuss the need for open standards and ‘key registers’ for critical data assets such as land and property information to support a cross-cutting, functional model for government. It will outline the value of a consistent, joined up evidence base to underpin all decisions around land and property, and service delivery to people at places. After all, everything happens somewhere.</p><p>This session is aimed at Chief Data Officers and the people responsible for delivering the government’s 2022-25 Roadmap for Digital and Data.</p><p><b>Format:</b> Presentation<br><b>Session leads:</b> Nick Chapallaz, Managing Director, GeoPlace and Juliet Whitworth, Research and Information Manager, Local Government Association<br><b>Open to:</b> All<br><b>Signup link:</b> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lga-and-geoplace-a-roadmap-for-digital-and-data-with-land-and-property-tickets-386999234127">Eventbrite page</a></p></p><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-386999234127"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() {console.log('Order complete!');};window.EBWidgets.createWidget({widgetType: 'checkout',eventId: '386999234127',iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-386999234127',});</script><h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id=11:00am-to-12:00pm-Effective-Data-Visualisation-in-the-DWP-–-A-Story>11:00am to 12:00pm Effective Data Visualisation in the DWP – A Story</h2><p><p>DWP MI is a strategic platform for delivering Management Information through data visualisations.
