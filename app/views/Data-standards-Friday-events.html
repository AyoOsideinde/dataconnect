Services like mental health support, housing advice, digital inclusion and social wellbeing need to be easy for users to find and interact with. They need to get the right information as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.<br>
<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority team who are working on introducing a government data standard for exchanging and publishing information on local public services: <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/">https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/</a><br>
The session will include experts from Essex County Council, Porism, Placecube, the Local Government Association, and will focus on the story so far in implementing the Open Referral UK standard across government .<br>
