Integrated Data Service (IDS) is for analysts in government, Devolved Administrations and external researchers to provide controlled access to a series of integrated Critical National Data Assets built, linked and maintained for deep analysis. In this session, Dominic Hale, the Head of Strategy for the Integrated Data Service will provide an overview of IDS, the achievements so far and the plans for the future.<br>
This session is for government employees only. <br>

<p>Format: Presentation and discussion<br>Speakers:<br> Dominic Hale is the Head of Strategy for the Integrated Data Service. His role includes setting the strategic direction of the programme, while ensuring alignment to government priorities and transformation across the DDAT domain, including the National Data Strategy & Declaration on Government Reform.

As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.</p>
<p>Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy. The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.</p>
<p>This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.</p>

Data science mentors provide advice and guidance to help a colleague develop technical skills through working on an analytical project. From a knotty technical question or new insight from their mentees’ data, to a different approach to project management or simply a new way of using Github, mentors report that they gain new skills and knowledge through mentoring others. It also provides opportunities their current role may not, such as demonstrating and developing skills like coaching, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>If you would like to share your data science skills and knowledge, learning yourself while helping others grow, there is a range of mentoring opportunities available at various skill levels. This session will provide an in-depth look at the data science mentoring movement and how you can be a part of it. It will provide more information on what’s involved, the programmes available and the support provided. There will also be an opportunity to put your questions to a panel of experienced data science mentors.</p>
