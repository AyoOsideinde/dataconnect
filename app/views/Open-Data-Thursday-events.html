This can be accidental, due to the huge complexities of ownership laws and administration, or it can be deliberate, allowing bad actors to benefit in ways they shouldn't be.<br>
It’s often difficult to know the truth of beneficial ownership from publicly available records, and improving transparency is emerging as an important tool for combating corruption, stemming illicit financial flows, and fighting tax evasion.  <br>
In this session, you'll hear from experts in CDDO's Data Standards Authority, Open Government at the Cabinet Office and Open Ownership to learn about our work in introducing a data standard for beneficial ownership across government.<br>
You'll find out about the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard itself, its use cases, the team's pathway to developing it for wider use, and the government's wider commitment to transparency in the context of the National Action Plan.<br>
