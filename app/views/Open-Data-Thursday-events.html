They will provide an overview of current work supporting government's objectives in the wider context of Business Identity.<br>You’ll also hear from Open Ownership who have developed the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS), whilst Isabella Fudge (Policy Advisor, Open Government at Cabinet Office) will talk about the UK government's commitments to transparency in the context of the National Action Plan. <br>
