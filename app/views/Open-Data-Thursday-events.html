<h2><div id="Thursday-1-00pm-to-2-00pm-Standardising-open-data-in-official-statistics">1.00pm to 2.00pm: Standardising open data in official statistics</div></h2><p>A story of how we’ve transformed publishing open data at the Department for Education and the lessons we’ve learnt while doing so. We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>
<p>Format: Case study presentation</p>
<p>Organiser(s) and organisation: Cam Race, cameron.race@education.gov.uk, Statistician at the Department for Education, working to improve government statistics through better open data and Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP).</p>
