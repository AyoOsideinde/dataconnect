<h2><div id="Thursday-1-00pm-to-2-00pm-Standardising-open-data-in-official-statistics">1.00pm to 2.00pm Standardising open data in official statistics</div></h2><p>A story of how we’ve transformed publishing open data at the Department for Education and the lessons we’ve learnt while doing so. We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>
<p>Format: Case study presentation</p>
<p>Organiser(s) and organisation: Cam Race, cameron.race@education.gov.uk, Statistician at the Department for Education, working to improve government statistics through better open data and Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP).</p>

Join Cristian Parrino, Chief Sustainability Officer at OpenUK and Rebecca Strickland from the Government Data Quality Hub, co-host of DataConnect21, as they discuss how open technology (data, software and hardware) can play a role in sustainability, and explore OpenUK's blueprint for the carbon negative data centre of the future.</p>

It's also sometimes unclear how public procurement deals have been reached. This can be accidental, due to the huge complexities of ownership laws and contractual administration, or it can be deliberate, allowing bad actors to benefit in ways they shouldn't be.<br>
Either way, it's often difficult to know the truth of beneficial ownership from publicly available records, and improving transparency is emerging as an important tool for combating corruption, stemming illicit financial flows, and fighting tax evasion.  <br>
In this session, you'll hear from experts in CDDO's Data Standards Authority, Open Government at the Cabinet Office and Open Ownership to learn about our work in introducing a data standard for beneficial ownership across government.<br>
You'll find out about the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard itself, its use cases, the team's pathway to developing it for wider use, and the government's wider commitment to transparency in the context of the National Action Plan.<br>
