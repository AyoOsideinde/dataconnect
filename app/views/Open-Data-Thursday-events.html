Most recently, on 1 September 2021, the UK government published a Declaration of National Commitment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/beneficial-ownership-disclosure-principles/declaration-of-national-commitment-to-meet-the-beneficial-ownership-transparency-disclosure-principles-accessible-version">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/beneficial-ownership-disclosure-principles/declaration-of-national-commitment-to-meet-the-beneficial-ownership-transparency-disclosure-principles-accessible-version</a><br>
to meet the beneficial ownership transparency disclosure principles. <br>
<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority (part of the Central Digital and Data Office) who together with the Global Digital Marketplace (part of Government Digital Service) launched a consultation:<br>
