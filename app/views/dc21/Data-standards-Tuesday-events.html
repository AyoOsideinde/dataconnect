<h2><div id="Tuesday-9-30am-to-11-00am-Practical-experiences-in-connecting-government-data">9:30am to 11:00am Practical experiences in connecting government data</div></h2><p>Description: In this session Swirrl will explain why itâ€™s useful to make data more connectable and what people are trying to achieve. Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources. We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy. All welcome. </p>
