Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources. We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy. All welcome. </p>

<p>Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) are the application of good practices from software engineering in analysis and research. They make analysis and research more reproducible, better quality, more trustworthy, and efficient. The recent Office for Stats Regulation review of RAP says "there is a huge potential to apply RAP principles both in and beyond official statistics".</p> <br>
<p>RAP is the linchpin of the digital transformation of government analysis. Through the high quality automation it brings, more effort can be directed towards building the research products that our users need. Recent successes like the UK Coronavirus Dashboard show how powerful government data can be in answering the needs of the public when sound RAP principles are applied.</p>
<p>However, learning the practices in RAP represent a substantial challenge for many government analysts - especially in a context where there is little prioritisation to build this capability and where the tools needed can be difficult to acquire. Our Coding in Analysis and Research survey shows that although most analysts feel it's important to implement the RAP principles in their work, many fewer are able to do so.</p>
<p>Our approach to RAP is multi-pronged to tackle the cultural, capability, and technical barriers that exist.</p> <br>
	<br>
<p>We operate a Champions network that engages across government and delivers mentoring, training, and advocacy within their respective departments,<br>We deliver consultancy and mentorship for organisations beginning their journey,<br>We advocate for the digital transformation of analysis with RAP at senior levels in government,<br>We monitor progress towards RAP and evaluate interventions,<br>
We role model good practice in our own analytical work.</p>
<p>Through our research of coding in analysis across government and the research of colleagues we identify next steps for public sector organisations and advocate for the inclusion of RAP principles at the heart of government analytical strategy. </p>

Despite the significant benefits they offer, the development and adoption of PETs has been slow due to various factors. <br>
The ICO will be addressing some of the perceived barriers to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty as they release guidance on PETs later in 2021. As part of its work on enabling data sharing, the ICO is developing regulatory guidance and tools on anonymisation, pseudonymisation and PETs. The use of effective anonymisation techniques gives organisations the ability to share data more widely as anonymous information is outside the scope of data protection legislation. Their latest chapter of the anonymisation guidance, ‘How do we ensure anonymisation is effective?’, covers the critical topic of identifiability and what data protection law requires you to do when assessing whether your approach results in effective anonymisation.</p>
<p>The team will discuss how data protection law applies where someone is ‘identified or identifiable’ and the concept of identifiability and how this is assessed in practice. Finally, it will discuss data protection in the context of PETs, including identifiability and key factors an organisation should consider. As part of the session, the team will also be running polls to gather audience opinion on key topics, for example, how the motivated intruder test can best be articulated for the future and our spectrum of identifiability approach.<br>
The CDEI will showcase the research it has done on PETs, the Centre’s understanding of policy and regulation issues, share our use case repository and walk through the adoption guide using an interactive case study exercise. The CDEI will also highlight the limitations of PETs and where they may not be a solution to privacy problems, with the aim to cut through some of the hype around these technologies. The CDEI hopes to crowdsource key problem areas where PETs are a compelling solution and build fruitful relationships with government stakeholders which could lead to future collaboration on projects demonstrating the value of PETs.</p>

Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. We’ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at Open Data Institute Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal. All welcome.</p>

Regardless of whether you work with a multi-national organisation or a government department, data is central to that success. What is becoming apparent is that the vast majority of employees within organisations don’t have the confidence with data to truly unlock its potential.   In fact, research shows that only 1 in 4 business decision makers would categorise themselves as being fully data literate. At executive level, this number is about 1 in 3. And, crucially, organisations don’t know what steps to take to rectify the skills gap – to place data literacy at the heart of their business.</p>
