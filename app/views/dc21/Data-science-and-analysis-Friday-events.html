<h2><div id="Friday-1-00pm-to-1-30pm-MoJ-Analytical-Platform-Helping-the-organisation-to-put-data-at-the-heart-of-decision-making">1:00pm to 1:30pm MoJ Analytical Platform-Helping the organisation to put data at the heart of decision making</div></h2><p>In this talk MoJ explain how they use the MoJ Analytical Platform to access cutting edge open-source tools, improving our ability to use data and evidence to drive decision making. It will include a brief introduction to the Analytical Platform, before a session on our Data Engineering which provides the near-live, record level data and has transformed the way the Ministry works, from analysis to operations. Our robust automated data infrastructure underpins MoJ’s analytical and data science products, driven by daily record level data and deployed at scale right across HQ and the front line. A live demonstration will be given of one our interactive apps which has been built and deployed by analysts using the Analytical Platform, to communicate analysis and insight to decision–makers</p>

As part of this review, we would like to speak with colleagues across public sector organisations to determine:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>what collaborations they have had/have with these kinds of organisations (with a focus on using collaborations to increase data science capability)</li>
<li>the successes and /or failures of these collaborations</li>
<li>whether they would be interested in utilising our collaborative agreements to increase data science capability within their organisations</li>
<li>how collaborative agreements can be used to increase data science capability across the public sector</li></ul></p>
<p>We would also like to hear from organisations outside of the public sector with regards to their experiences of collaborating to increase data science capability and are also keen to hear from organisations that are interested in collaborating with us.</p>

<p>Drawing from over 32 HMG, commercial and open sources, the data and analytical capability delivered by the Border Flow Service is used to respond to emerging issues, in real-time, at the border including emergencies and changing trends, with agility.</p>
<p>This will be an opportunity to share the X-HMG use case for such a service, the data sharing challenges the team overcame, the technology underpinning it and future evolutions of the service.</p>
<p>Format: Show and Tell</p>
<p>Audience: This session would be of interest to data analysts and strategic management who are looking to ensure data quality, consistency and practical application of good data governance principles.</p>
