<h2><div id="Monday-1-00pm-to-2-00pm-An-introduction-to-cross-government-data-standards">1:00pm to 2:00pm An introduction to cross-government data standards</div></h2><p>What are data standards and why are they essential for sharing data across government? How do you get a data standard officially recognised for cross-government use, and how do you make sure it gets adopted by users?  Join Terence Eden and Peter Gothard from the Data Standards Authority, Central and Digital and Data Office as they demystify data standards and the process of defining, identifying, endorsing, and using a data standard.</p>
<p> This session is suitable for anyone interested in using data standards to improve data sharing with other organisations. </p>

<p>With the climate emergency looming, sea-levels are rising, the weather is becoming more extreme and erratic, so a real-world example would be the ever-increasing threat of flooding. In the UK Met Office records show that 9 of the 17 record-breaking rainfall months or seasons since 1910 have occurred within the last 20 years. </p>
<p>Chris Hansford will talk us through how the use of publicly available data can be used to help alert, warn and protect us from these catastrophic weather events. All welcome.</p>
