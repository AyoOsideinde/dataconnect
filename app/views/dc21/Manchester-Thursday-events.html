<p>It states, “We will look beyond London to all corners of the UK, as part of our mission to be a government more like the country we serve. More civil servants, including senior leaders, will work outside of the capital, joining the many dedicated front line staff already based in towns and cities across the UK.”</p>
<p>Therefore, a key action for 2021 is to implement plans to move 22,000 roles out of London by 2030, including 50% of Senior Civil Servant (SCS) roles, confirming at least five major departmental relocations this year.</p>
<p>As part of the GDS and Central Digital and Data Office location strategy, many new roles will be created in Manchester and Bristol, across a range of professions and capabilities, for the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>This session from Manchester Digital will discuss the current digital and data skills picture in Manchester and the UK, the challenges employers can overcome, and the initiatives that can be used to recruit and retain UK wide digital, data and technology specialists.</p>
