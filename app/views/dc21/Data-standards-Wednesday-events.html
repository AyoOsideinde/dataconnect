<h2><div id="Wednesday-10-00am-to-10-45am-Improving-coherence-of-government-statistics">10:00am to 10:45am Improving coherence of government statistics</div></h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of providing the public with coherent and accessible statistics where there are multiple producers. As statistical producers, we must challenge ourselves not to simply publish a set of numbers, but to explain how they relate to other data on that topic, and how they combine with other statistics to better explain the part of the world they describe. We must also be able to explain the consistency and comparability of statistics across the UK.</p>
<p>Improving the availability and coherence of data links closely to the inclusivity strand the UKSA Statistics for the Public Good strategy. The GSS coherence teams will share examples of how we have worked across the statistical system and developed different products to ensure that our statistics tell a more joined up and coherent story. This is most notable in topic areas which are devolved, meaning across the UK different policies and data collections vary, for example, housing & homelessness, income & earnings and adult social care.</p>
<p>This session will challenge statistical producers to develop their system-wide working and collaboration, as well as highlighting similarities and differences in statistics on key topics across the UK for all attendees, allowing the statistics to be more effectively understood. There will also be opportunities to discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing coherent statistics in a dynamic environment of devolved policy making (and divergence), changing user needs, and calls for greater data sharing.</p>

Drawing on principles from the soon to be published Data Sharing Governance Framework, we set out what a cross-government standardised and coordinated approach to the non-technical elements of data sharing can fix, what change looks like over time and how the not-so-usual suspects can support faster and easier data sharing.</p>

<p>Watch Paul Downey, Euan Mills, Katie Glaubius and Paul Smith talk about how we make land and housing data easier to find, use and trust.</p>
<p>Digital Land is a team in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities working aiming to make land and housing data easier to find, use and trust. We believe better, more easily consumed data will lead to better decisions and fewer uncertainties and delays in the housing system, and more new digital services for property and planning.<br>
This session will feature talks and demonstrations from our policy, user research, design and technical leads on the externalities and other barriers local planning authorities and other decision makers face making better data available.<br>
Come and hear about the team’s approach to collecting, processing, and presenting data, and providing feedback to publishers, and other ways the team have been exploring to help publishers overcome these barriers.<br>
This event is for designed for those working in local and national government.</p>
