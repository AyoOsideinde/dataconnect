The UK Statistics Authority has developed a framework and portfolio of services to empower analysts to consider the ethics of their research quickly and easily, at the research design phase. This session will provide an overview of this framework and accompanying user support services. </p>

This highlighted the requirement to find a faster, more accurate and secure method for quickly identifying those in need during any type of emergency incident where local residents might be in danger. This talk will cover how this has successfully been achieved with impressive results. .</p>

We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>

We have tracked value for money decisions and supporting evaluations by mapping geospatial data at a granular level – a relatively nascent endeavour within the Organisation – and have relied heavily on usually disparate data sources of varying quality which have been captured by Local Authorities of differing capacity and by private sector organisations. </p>
<p>We will present a case study from our cycling data insights project, which aimed to develop our understanding of the current data landscape and demonstrate the utility of data in government. As part of this project, we developed an experimental, proof-of-concept dashboard as a means of visualising the extent of cycling data maturity in Local Authorities, so as to enhance our understanding of cycling investment and its impact. </p>
<p>This session is for the benefit of government colleagues and will include a showcase of the dashboard and a discussion of how we used data when assembling our visualisations. </p>
