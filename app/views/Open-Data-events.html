We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>
<p>Format: Case study presentation</p>
<p>Organiser(s) and organisation: Cam Race, cameron.race@education.gov.uk, Statistician at the Department for Education, working to improve government statistics through better open data and Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP).</p>

<h2>Tuesday - </h2><h2><div id="Tuesday-11-00am-to-12-00pm-Creative-collaborative-data-challenge-communities">11:00am to 12:00pm Creative collaborative data challenge communities</div></h2><p>At Open Data Institute Leeds we have a firm belief in the network effect of a strong community around a data challenge. Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. We’ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at Open Data Institute Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal. All welcome.</p>

<h2>Wednesday - </h2><h2><div id="Wednesday-10-00am-to-11-00am-Mapping-the-data-initiatives-in-the-UK-government">10.00am to 11.00am Mapping the data initiatives in the UK government</div></h2><p>'Data' means many different things in government, and there are many organisations with different roles and responsibilities undertaking lots of data-related initiatives. This makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what. Over the summer, the Open Data Institute (ODI) has been crowdsourcing a list of the UK government organisations responsible for data and the projects they're involved in. In this session, the ODI discuss what they found with key data leaders in government.</p> <br>
