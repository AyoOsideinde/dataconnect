Data can help the government deliver services that are suited to the individual needs of citizens, with wide-reaching effects.<br>But achieving this has to be a collaboration. We all have to work together to drive data-enabled transformation for everyone.<br>Join the senior leaders of GDS and CDDO as they discuss how we are approaching these challenges. Deputy Director of Data and Innovation at the CDDO Sue Bateman will host a panel including CDDO chairman Paul Willmott and CDDO Chief Data Officer Nigel Matthews.<br>
