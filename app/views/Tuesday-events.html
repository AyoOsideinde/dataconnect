<p><b> Registration and joining information:</b> TBC </p><br>
<p><b> Description:</b>In this session Swirrl will explain why it’s useful to make data more connectable and what people are trying to achieve.</p><br>
<p>Our Office for National Statistics and Environment Agency colleagues will explain how this contributes to the objectives of their organisations and programmes.</p><br>
<p>We'll talk about why it's hard and the kinds of challenges that need to be tackled, for example around standardisation, managing reference data, harmonisation of data from different sources.</p><br>
<p> We'll present practical examples and cover both technical approaches and how these fit into the working processes of the organisations, illustrating this with real examples.</p><br>
<p> We'll discuss how similar approaches could be adopted more broadly, how this relates to the National Data Strategy </p><br>

<p><b> Registration and joining information:</b> TBC </p><br>
<p><b> Description:</b> In this session the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) will provide an overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and how they can be used by government teams interested in applying them but unsure of where to begin. </p><br>
<p>We will showcase the research we have done, our understanding of policy and regulation issues, share the use case repository and walk through the adoption guide using an interactive case study exercise. </p><br>
<p>We will also highlight the limitations of PETs and where they may not be a solution to privacy problems, and aim to cut through some of the hype around these technologies. </p><br>
<p>Through this session, we hope to crowdsource key problem areas where PETs are a compelling solution and build fruitful relationships with government stakeholders which could lead to future collaboration on projects demonstrating the value of PETs. </p><br>
<p> This workshop will be useful for data and technical architects, developers, data scientists, and product owners working on data-driven projects in the public sector, particularly those interested in maximising the value of sensitive datasets.</p><br>

<br>
Short description<br>
Organisations, unlike a lot of Government Departments are constantly looking for the competitive edge to remain successful, profitable and, ultimately, long-lasting.  However regardless of whether you work with a Multi-national Organisation or a Government Dept data is central to that success. Unfortunately, what is becoming apparent is that the vast majority of employees within organisations don’t have the confidence with data to truly unlock its potential.   In fact,  research shows that only 1 in 4 business decision makers would categorise themselves as being fully data literate. At executive level, this number is about 1 in 3. And, crucially, organisations don’t know what steps to take to rectify the skills gap – to place data literacy at the heart of their business.<br>
