Drawing from over 32 HMG, commercial and open sources, the data and analytical capability delivered by the Border Flow Service is used to respond to emerging issues, in real-time, at the border including emergencies and changing trends, with agility.<br>
This will be an opportunity to share the X-HMG use case for such a service, the data sharing challenges the team overcame, the technology underpinning it and future evolutions of the service.</p>
<p>Format: Show and Tell</p>
<p>Audience: This session would be of interest to data analysts and strategic management who are looking to ensure data quality, consistency and practical application of good data governance principles.</p>
