As part of this we routinely work  with commercial, HR and financial data as an enabling force for our programmes. In this session we will discuss: <br>
-What we collect<br>
-Why we collect it and how it informs our work<br>
-The challenges we and other capability teams face from a data perspective <br>
-How that can be improved</p>

<p>Local Authorities in Scotland have joined forces with the Digital Office for Scottish Local Government to understand how they can use data to achieve positive outcomes for their organisations, the wider sector, and citizens. The Data Task Force are also collaborating with the Scottish Government on a number of challenges from improving data maturity, the development of a Data Transformation Framework, and to make it easier to find public sector data through a CivTech Innovation Challenge.</p>
<p>Speakers:<br>
- Kimberley Hose, Head of Business Intelligence Glasgow City Council and Chair of the Data Task Force Advisory Group<br>
- Alex Hamilton, Business Development Officer for North Lanarkshire Council and Chair of the Data Task Force Capability Squad<br>
- Shona Nicol, Data and Digital Identity Division - Scottish Government<p><br>

Centre for Net Zero was set up to find faster, fairer, and more affordable ways to get there.<br>
Centre for Net Zero is building the world’s most advanced, openly accessible agent-based model (ABM) of the energy transition, which will be launched in Autumn 2021. It will enable us to understand how people adopt and use low carbon technologies — like heat pumps and electric vehicles — both now and in the future. We’re able to build this simulation on the basis of the increasing availability of data on the adoption of these technologies. We’ve done a lot of work digging into the data, and we want to share what we’ve found so far in our Home Decarbonisation Index. It estimates how many kilograms of CO2 are now being saved by the installation of these technologies over the past decade, and ranks all UK local authorities from best to worst savers of CO2. <br>
Whilst there’s more data out there than ever before regarding the adoption of low-carbon technologies, it isn’t easy to discover for most people. It’s often buried in endless government datasets and sometimes formatted for print instead of for analysts (e.g. the title of the table in the first row instead of field names). Different teams are responsible for reporting, so getting close to a complete picture requires a lot of legwork.<br>
We wanted to bring the data about low-carbon technologies together in one place, which has been a pleasure to do, but it brought up two questions that we’d like to discuss with the DDaT and GSS data science professional communities that work with BEIS, DfT, MLUHC, and others that work across the energy, transport, and buildings sectors:<br>
- As an open research lab, we want to use the most accessible technologies to share data with government, our partners, the private sector, and the third sector. We’ve placed a CSV file for download, but what would you prefer? More CSV? APIs? Just better metadata?<br>
 - We know that the way that the data is presented gives (too much?) credit to places with the lowest barriers to acquiring low-carbon technologies. Examples include places where residential density is low, few people live in flats and more people own their own home and vehicle. How could we present the data in a way that calculates and accounts for these barriers? Even better, can we account for lower-carbon intensive lifestyles ‘built-in’ to places with higher residential density and lower personal car use?</p>

Drawing from over 32 HMG, commercial and open sources, the data and analytical capability delivered by the Border Flow Service is used to respond to emerging issues, in real-time, at the border including emergencies and changing trends, with agility.<br>
This will be an opportunity to share the X-HMG use case for such a service, the data sharing challenges the team overcame, the technology underpinning it and future evolutions of the service.</p>
<p>Format: Show and Tell</p>
<p>Audience: This session would be of interest to data analysts and strategic management who are looking to ensure data quality, consistency and practical application of good data governance principles.</p>
