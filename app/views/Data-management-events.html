Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality) provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed.

Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </a></p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>

Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. We’ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at Open Data Institute Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal. All welcome.</p>

<h2>Wednesday - </h2><h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

<h2>Friday - </h2><h2><div id="Friday-9-30am-to-10-30am-Government-Data-Management-Community">9:30am to 10:30am Government Data Management Community</div></h2><p>The Government Data Quality Hub and the Data Standards Authority created DataConnect to give people from across government and the public sector working with data an opportunity to come together to share their challenges and successes. But where do we go from here?</p>
<p>One of the opportunities in the National Data Strategy is a new cross-government Data Management Community.</p>
<p>We know there are many people working on data management across government and the public sector. And there are many different data communities. We’re interested in finding out if these communities are providing you with the support you need? Are they embedding silos across government or breaking them down? Are there gaps? What even IS data management anyway? </p>
<p>This session is open to anyone who is working on data management, even if it’s not your ‘official’ job title.</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at the following question:<br>
<ul><li>What’s the challenge with bringing people together around data management, and is a cross-government community a good solution? </li></ul></p>
<p>Additional questions:<br>
<ul><li>How would a new cross-gov data management community add value to your work?</li>
<li>How would a cross-gov data management community collaborate with existing data communities and networks inside and outside of government? </li>
<li>How do we make sure the people who need it most can be a part of it? </li></ul><br>
