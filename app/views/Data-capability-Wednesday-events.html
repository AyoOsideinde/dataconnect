<h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

Data science mentors provide advice and guidance to help a colleague develop technical skills through working on an analytical project. From a knotty technical question or new insight from their mentees’ data, to a different approach to project management or simply a new way of using Github, mentors report that they gain new skills and knowledge through mentoring others. It also provides opportunities their current role may not, such as demonstrating and developing skills like coaching, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>If you would like to share your data science skills and knowledge, learning yourself while helping others grow, there is a range of mentoring opportunities available at various skill levels. This session will provide an in-depth look at the data science mentoring movement and how you can be a part of it. It will provide more information on what’s involved, the programmes available and the support provided. There will also be an opportunity to put your questions to a panel of experienced data science mentors.</p>
