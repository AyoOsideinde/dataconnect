<h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-A-citizen-first-approach-to-getting-value-from-APIs-in-government">10.00am to 11.00am - A citizen-first approach to getting value from APIs in government</div></h2><p>Governments globally are increasingly exploring ways to deliver more value from services to a greater population of the wider community, using data exchange via APIs to enable them. Learning from case studies and techniques that have been proven overseas and in other industry sectors, can help build the case for, and extract more value from, API-related investment. This  session shares research and insights from case studies and API programs in government and non-government sectors.</p>
