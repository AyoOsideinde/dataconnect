<h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-A-citizen-first-approach-to-getting-value-from-APIs-in-government">10.00am to 11.00am - A citizen-first approach to getting value from APIs in government</div></h2><p>Governments globally are increasingly exploring ways to deliver more value from services to a greater population of the wider community, using data exchange via APIs to enable them. Learning from case studies and techniques that have been proven overseas and in other industry sectors, can help build the case for, and extract more value from, API-related investment. This  session shares research and insights from case studies and API programs in government and non-government sectors.</p>

(Security, Privacy, and Convenience are not Mutually Exclusive) session yesterday, we will look at how our platform could be utilised in a use case with the Food Standards Agency.<br>
We will:<br>
- Consider the architecture<br>
- Configure and represent APIs in Auth0<br>
- Identify machine to machine clients<br>
- Consider how we can minimise FSAs manual involvement in local deployments</p>
