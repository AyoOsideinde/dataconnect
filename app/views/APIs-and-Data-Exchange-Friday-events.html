<h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-A-citizen-first-approach-to-getting-value-from-APIs-in-government">10.00am to 11.00am - A citizen-first approach to getting value from APIs in government</div></h2><p>Governments globally are increasingly exploring ways to deliver more value from services to a greater population of the wider community, using data exchange via APIs to enable them. Learning from case studies and techniques that have been proven overseas and in other industry sectors, can help build the case for, and extract more value from, API-related investment. This  session shares research and insights from case studies and API programs in government and non-government sectors.</p>

(Hands-On Workshop)</div></h2><p>Auth0 present a session looking at what citizens expect, and how that differs from what has traditionally been offered. We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.<br>
We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.<br>
In this session we will discuss:<br>
- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations<br>
- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions<br>
- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise</p>

Featuring Adam Locker and Ross Mcdonald talking about the theory behind this approach and sharing what they learned in a recent discovery.</p>
