Our members have access to a range of materials to support their professional development. In this webinar we will introduce you to DAMA and how we can help you to develop your data management career. James Tucker will explain why the ONS joined DAMA and explain how the Govt Data Quality Framework is an example of the symbiotic relationship between DAMA and the ONS.</p>

We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>

Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality)</a><br>
provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed. </p>
<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>

We have tracked value for money decisions and supporting evaluations by mapping geospatial data at a granular level – a relatively nascent endeavour within the Organisation – and have relied heavily on usually disparate data sources of varying quality which have been captured by Local Authorities of differing capacity and by private sector organisations. </p>
<p>We will present a case study from our cycling data insights project, which aimed to develop our understanding of the current data landscape and demonstrate the utility of data in government. As part of this project, we developed an experimental, proof-of-concept dashboard as a means of visualising the extent of cycling data maturity in Local Authorities, so as to enhance our understanding of cycling investment and its impact. </p>
<p>This session is for the benefit of government colleagues and will include a showcase of the dashboard and a discussion of how we used data when assembling our visualisations. </p>

Rebecca Leader is the Data Transformation Lead for the Supporting Families Programme in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Her role is focused on improving the use of data, systems and analytics in local authority partnerships to help support families through the identification and prevention of multiple and complex issues. She has worked to develop tools to provide a framework for data maturity, allow local authorities to assess their own maturity in this field and monitor national progress. Her approach is to equip local authorities to build solid foundations and systems on which robust analytics can be applied. Rebecca has worked in a police force on research and strategy planning, led data teams in a local authority across Supporting Families and Early Help, Youth Offending, Childrens Services. She has been in the national team since 2018..</p>
