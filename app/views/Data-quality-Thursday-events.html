<h2><div id="Thursday-1-00pm-to-2-00pm-Standardising-open-data-in-official-statistics">1.00pm to 2.00pm: Standardising open data in official statistics</div></h2><p>A story of how we’ve transformed publishing open data at the Department for Education and the lessons we’ve learnt while doing so. We’ve ripped up our approach and started again, focussing on our users. We’ve built a bespoke dissemination platform, standardised our data, and worked with analysts to overhaul the dissemination for over 145 Official Statistics releases (and counting!).</p>
<p>Format: Case study presentation</p>
<p>Organiser(s) and organisation: Cam Race, cameron.race@education.gov.uk, Statistician at the Department for Education, working to improve government statistics through better open data and Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP).</p>

Assessing data maturity in government</div></h2><p>Description: Data should be at the heart of our decision-making. Often, though, things get in the way - poor data management, patchy data governance, or a lack of skills and knowledge. Data maturity models <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-guidance#data-maturity-models-and-quality provide organisations with a framework to better understand their data capability, and to set strategic direction for data. Regular assessments are used to determine an organisation’s current maturity, to measure progress, and to highlight areas where improvement is needed.

<p>This session will introduce the concept of data maturity assessments, and will explore how these can be used to kick-start improvements in data capability. Attendees will be introduced to work on a data maturity model for government, and will learn from organisations across the public and third sectors that have successfully applied a data maturity approach to improve business outcomes. The session will end with a panel Q&A.</p>
