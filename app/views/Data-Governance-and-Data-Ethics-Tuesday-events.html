Despite the significant benefits they offer, the development and adoption of PETs has been slow due to various factors. <br>
The ICO will be addressing some of the perceived barriers to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty as they release guidance on PETs later in 2021. As part of its work on enabling data sharing, the ICO is developing regulatory guidance and tools on anonymisation, pseudonymisation and PETs. The use of effective anonymisation techniques gives organisations the ability to share data more widely as anonymous information is outside the scope of data protection legislation. Their latest chapter of the anonymisation guidance, ‘How do we ensure anonymisation is effective?’, covers the critical topic of identifiability and what data protection law requires you to do when assessing whether your approach results in effective anonymisation.<br>
The team will discuss how data protection law applies where someone is ‘identified or identifiable’ and the concept of identifiability and how this is assessed in practice. Finally, it will discuss data protection in the context of PETs, including identifiability and key factors an organisation should consider. As part of the session, the team will also be running polls to gather audience opinion on key topics, for example, how the motivated intruder test can best be articulated for the future and our spectrum of identifiability approach.<br>
The CDEI will showcase the research it has done on PETs, the Centre’s understanding of policy and regulation issues, share our use case repository and walk through the adoption guide using an interactive case study exercise. The CDEI will also highlight the limitations of PETs and where they may not be a solution to privacy problems, with the aim to cut through some of the hype around these technologies. The CDEI hopes to crowdsource key problem areas where PETs are a compelling solution and build fruitful relationships with government stakeholders which could lead to future collaboration on projects demonstrating the value of PETs.</p>

Regardless of whether you work with a multi-national organisation or a government department, data is central to that success. What is becoming apparent is that the vast majority of employees within organisations don’t have the confidence with data to truly unlock its potential.   In fact, research shows that only 1 in 4 business decision makers would categorise themselves as being fully data literate. At executive level, this number is about 1 in 3. And, crucially, organisations don’t know what steps to take to rectify the skills gap – to place data literacy at the heart of their business.</p>
