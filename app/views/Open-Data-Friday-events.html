Services like mental health support, housing advice, digital inclusion and social wellbeing activities need to be easy for users to find and interact with. They need to get the right information as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority team who in April  highlighted a need for a data standard for exchanging and publishing information on local public services: <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/ ">https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/ </a><br> and then ran a consultation to identify a suitable standard: <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/77">https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/77</a><br>In addition, the session will include participation from Essex County Council, Porism, Placecube, Local Government Association, and focus on the work done to date around the implementation of the Open Referral UK standard, the benefits and where it’s going next.<br>
