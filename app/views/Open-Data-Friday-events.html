Services like mental health support, housing advice, digital inclusion and social wellbeing activities need to be easy for users to find and interact with. They need to get the right information as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.<br>
<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority team who in April [highlighted the need for a standard](<a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/) for exchanging and publishing information on local public services and then ran a [consultation](https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/77) to identify a suitable standard.">https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/) for exchanging and publishing information on local public services and then ran a [consultation](https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/77) to identify a suitable standard.</a><br>
