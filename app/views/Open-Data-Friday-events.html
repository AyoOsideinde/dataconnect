<h2><div id="Friday-10-00am-to-11-00am-Improving-vulnerable-people-services-through-data-standards">10:00am to 11:00am Improving vulnerable people services through data standards</div></h2><p>People who need assistance from social, health or other public services have a huge variety of needs and accessibility requirements. Services like mental health support, housing advice, digital inclusion and social wellbeing need to be easy for users to find and interact with. They need to get the right information as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.<br>
<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority team who are working on introducing a government data standard for exchanging and publishing information on local public services: <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/">https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/28/vulnerable-people-services-data-standard/</a><br>
The session will include experts from Essex County Council, Porism, Placecube, the Local Government Association, and will focus on the story so far in implementing the Open Referral UK standard across government .<br>

Centre for Net Zero was set up to find faster, fairer, and more affordable ways to get there.</p>
<p>Centre for Net Zero is building the world’s most advanced, openly accessible agent-based model (ABM) of the energy transition, which will be launched in Autumn 2021. It will enable us to understand how people adopt and use low carbon technologies — like heat pumps and electric vehicles — both now and in the future. We’re able to build this simulation on the basis of the increasing availability of data on the adoption of these technologies. We’ve done a lot of work digging into the data, and we want to share what we’ve found so far in our Home Decarbonisation Index. It estimates how many kilograms of CO2 are now being saved by the installation of these technologies over the past decade, and ranks all UK local authorities from best to worst savers of CO2. </p>
<p>Whilst there’s more data out there than ever before regarding the adoption of low-carbon technologies, it isn’t easy to discover for most people. It’s often buried in endless government datasets and sometimes formatted for print instead of for analysts (e.g. the title of the table in the first row instead of field names). Different teams are responsible for reporting, so getting close to a complete picture requires a lot of legwork.</p>
<p>We wanted to bring the data about low-carbon technologies together in one place, which has been a pleasure to do, but it brought up two questions that we’d like to discuss with the DDaT and GSS data science professional communities that work with BEIS, DfT, MLUHC, and others that work across the energy, transport, and buildings sectors:</p>
<p>- As an open research lab, we want to use the most accessible technologies to share data with government, our partners, the private sector, and the third sector. We’ve placed a CSV file for download, but what would you prefer? More CSV? APIs? Just better metadata?</p>
<p> - We know that the way that the data is presented gives (too much?) credit to places with the lowest barriers to acquiring low-carbon technologies. Examples include places where residential density is low, few people live in flats and more people own their own home and vehicle. How could we present the data in a way that calculates and accounts for these barriers? Even better, can we account for lower-carbon intensive lifestyles ‘built-in’ to places with higher residential density and lower personal car use?</p>
