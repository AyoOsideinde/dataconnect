<h2><div id="Tuesday-11-00am-to-12-00pm-Creative-collaborative-data-challenge-communities">11:00am to 12:00pm Creative collaborative data challenge communities</div></h2><p>At Open Data Institute Leeds we have a firm belief in the network effect of a strong community around a data challenge. Nothing beats collaborating on a challenge with like-minded individuals. Weâ€™ve repeatedly used this simple idea to form ad hoc collaborative communities to address a general or specific data need. In this session Giles Dring, Head of Delivery at Open Data Institute Leeds, will present some tips on creating sustainable collaborative data communities, from how best to form a community (and why you might need one in the first place) through to maintaining and ultimately retiring or graduating the community into something more formal. All welcome.</p>
