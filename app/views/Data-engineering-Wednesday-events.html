<h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

A joint session from Public Health England and Joint Biosecurity Centre on two innovations in collection, sharing and using public health data.<br>Joint Biosecurity Centre: The pandemic has uncovered the need - and potential - for novel, non-traditional health data to inform the health protection response. A limitation of translating non-health data in public health action is determining the most relevant level of geography. In the UK, the administrative and statistical building blocks coincide at the Local Authority level. However, Local Authority boundaries do not necessarily capture the way communities actually live and work. We have been looking at alternative ways to aggregate data to address this problem. This will be illustrated through the case of Wastewater monitoring.<br>Public Health England: The UK coronavirus dashboard is the government source of data on the pandemic and is praised by national and international bodies, including the Prime Minister, Health Secretary, National Statistician, and members of the public for its comprehensiveness, integrity, and agility. The talk will look at how PHE have produced the dashboard, with a particular focus on the use of APIs.</p>

This will be a practical session with examples from Skills, Vulnerability, Industry and Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP). We’ll also introduce the concept of collaborative and centralised governance through a cross-government Taxonomy Oversight Group.</p>
