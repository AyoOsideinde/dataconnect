It will include a brief introduction to the Analytical Platform, before a session on our Data Engineering which provides the near-live, record level data and has transformed the way the Ministry works, from analysis to operations. Our robust automated data infrastructure underpins MoJ’s analytical and data science products, driven by daily record level data and deployed at scale right across HQ and the front line. A live demonstration will be given of one our interactive apps which has been built and deployed by analysts using the Analytical Platform, to communicate analysis and insight to decision–makers</p>

(Security, Privacy, and Convenience are not Mutually Exclusive) session yesterday, we will look at how our platform could be utilised in a use case with the Food Standards Agency.<br>
We will:<br>
- Consider the architecture<br>
- Configure and represent APIs in Auth0<br>
- Identify machine to machine clients<br>
- Consider how we can minimise FSAs manual involvement in local deployments</p>

<p>Drawing from over 32 HMG, commercial and open sources, the data and analytical capability delivered by the Border Flow Service is used to respond to emerging issues, in real-time, at the border including emergencies and changing trends, with agility.</p>
<p>This will be an opportunity to share the X-HMG use case for such a service, the data sharing challenges the team overcame, the technology underpinning it and future evolutions of the service.</p>
<p>Format: Show and Tell</p>
<p>Audience: This session would be of interest to data analysts and strategic management who are looking to ensure data quality, consistency and practical application of good data governance principles.</p>
