It will include a brief introduction to the Analytical Platform, before a session on our Data Engineering which provides the near-live, record level data and has transformed the way the Ministry works, from analysis to operations. Our robust automated data infrastructure underpins MoJ’s analytical and data science products, driven by daily record level data and deployed at scale right across HQ and the front line. A live demonstration will be given of one our interactive apps which has been built and deployed by analysts using the Analytical Platform, to communicate analysis and insight to decision–makers</p>
