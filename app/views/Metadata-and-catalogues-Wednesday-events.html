This event is an open discussion of the kinds of features we as data practitioners of various types would like to have in the data catalogues we use. The event is particularly aimed at people who actively interact with data catalogues of various kinds, who have a sense of the limitations of current systems and the capabilities we wish they had and sharing of any best-practices or principles.</p>
<p>Primary audience: data scientists, developers, data curators, data governance managers who use data catalogues and related tools. Also potentially useful to data team managers, CDOs and other leaders.</p>
<p>Format: Open roundtable discussion via Zoom</p>
