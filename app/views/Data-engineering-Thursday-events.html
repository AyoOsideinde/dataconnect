<h2><div id="Thursday-4-00pm-to-4-30pm-Security-Privacy-and-Convenience-are-not-Mutually-Exclusive">4:00pm to 4:30pm - Security, Privacy, and Convenience are not Mutually Exclusive</div></h2><p>Auth0 present a session looking at what citizens expect, and how that differs from what has traditionally been offered. We will explore modern ideas around privacy, and intelligent ways in which we can avoid the constant battle between Security, Privacy, and Convenience.<br>
We have been told that choices must be made - but Auth0 believes this to be false.<br>
In this session we will discuss:<br>
- The need to meet the ever growing list of citizen expectations<br>
- How the desire for convenience and security is driving citizens to seek out modern identity solutions<br>
- How you can deliver Security, Privacy, and Convenience without compromise<br>
This session will be followed by a hands on implementation workshop on Friday: <a href="https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-">https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/Friday#Friday-2-00pm-to-3-30pm-How-would-I-Secure-FSA-APIs-with-Auth0-Hands-On-Workshop-</a><br>
