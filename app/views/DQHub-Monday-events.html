But it isn't always easy to know what make data fit for purpose, or to know how to fix quality problems when you find them. </p>
<p>Data Quality Action Plans can help! Come and hear more about what they are and how they can help you better understand and improve your data.</p>
<p>This session from the Government Data Quality Hub is aimed at anyone interested in understanding quality as part of data management. We will be running small workshops later in the week for people who would like to talk through the steps in creating their own Data Quality Action Plans.</p>
