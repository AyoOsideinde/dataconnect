It's also sometimes unclear how public procurement deals have been reached. This can be accidental, due to the huge complexities of ownership laws and contractual administration, or it can be deliberate, allowing bad actors to benefit in ways they shouldn't be.<br>
Either way, it's often difficult to know the truth of beneficial ownership from publicly available records, and improving transparency is emerging as an important tool for combating corruption, stemming illicit financial flows, and fighting tax evasion.  <br>
In this session, you'll hear from experts in CDDO's Data Standards Authority, Open Government at the Cabinet Office and Open Ownership to learn about our work in introducing a data standard for beneficial ownership across government.<br>
You'll find out about the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard itself, its use cases, the team's pathway to developing it for wider use, and the government's wider commitment to transparency in the context of the National Action Plan.<br>

Her role is focused on improving the use of data, systems and analytics in local authority partnerships to help support families through the identification and prevention of multiple and complex issues.
