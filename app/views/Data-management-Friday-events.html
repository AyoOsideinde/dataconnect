<h2><div id="Friday-9-30am-to-10-30am-Do-we-need-a-cross-Government-Data-Management-Community-">9:30am to 10:30am Do we need a cross-Government Data Management Community?</div></h2><p>The Government Data Quality Hub and the Data Standards Authority created DataConnect to give people from across government and the public sector working with data an opportunity to come together to share their challenges and successes. But where do we go from here?</p>
<p>One of the opportunities in the National Data Strategy is a new cross-government Data Management Community.</p>
<p>We know there are many people working on data management across government and the public sector. And there are many different data communities. We’re interested in finding out if these communities are providing you with the support you need? Are they embedding silos across government or breaking them down? Are there gaps? What even IS data management anyway? </p>
<p>This session is open to anyone who is working on data management, even if it’s not your ‘official’ job title.</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at the following question:<br>
<ul><li>What’s the challenge with bringing people together around data management, and is a cross-government community a good solution? </li></ul></p>
<p>Additional questions:<br>
<ul><li>How would a new cross-gov data management community add value to your work?</li>
<li>How would a cross-gov data management community collaborate with existing data communities and networks inside and outside of government? </li>
<li>How do we make sure the people who need it most can be a part of it? </li></ul><br>

Services like mental health support, housing advice, digital inclusion and social wellbeing activities need to be easy for users to find and interact with. They need to get the right information as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.<br>In this session, you’ll hear from the Data Standards Authority team who in April highlighted the need for a standard for exchanging and publishing information on local public services and then ran a consultation to identify a suitable standard.<br>In addition, the session will include participation from Essex County Council (Ben Unsworth), Porism (Mike Thacker), Local Government Association (Tim Adams), and focus on the work done to date around the implementation of the Open Referral UK standard, the benefits and where it’s going next.<br>

We will explain the multitude of ways in which the Environment Agency represents Place data, how this has been conceptually modelled and how this will be used to improve our data.<br>You don't need to be a data modelling expert to join this presentation - Becky and Sarah's presentation is a fantastic introduction to the benefits of using data modelling to solve sticky challenges in your data. <br>This session is brought to you by the GDAC Data Modelling community of practice.<br>

<p>Local Authorities in Scotland have joined forces with the Digital Office for Scottish Local Government to understand how they can use data to achieve positive outcomes for their organisations, the wider sector, and citizens. The Data Task Force are also collaborating with the Scottish Government on a number of challenges from improving data maturity, the development of a Data Transformation Framework, and to make it easier to find public sector data through a CivTech Innovation Challenge.</p>
