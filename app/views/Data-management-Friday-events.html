<h2><div id="Friday-9-30am-to-10-30am-Government-Data-Management-Community">9:30am to 10:30am Government Data Management Community</div></h2><p>The Government Data Quality Hub and the Data Standards Authority created DataConnect to give people from across government and the public sector working with data an opportunity to come together to share their challenges and successes. But where do we go from here?</p>
<p>One of the opportunities in the National Data Strategy is a new cross-government Data Management Community.</p>
<p>We know there are many people working on data management across government and the public sector. And there are many different data communities. We’re interested in finding out if these communities are providing you with the support you need? Are they embedding silos across government or breaking them down? Are there gaps? What even IS data management anyway? </p>
<p>This session is open to anyone who is working on data management, even if it’s not your ‘official’ job title.</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at the following question:<br>
<ul><li>What’s the challenge with bringing people together around data management, and is a cross-government community a good solution? </li></ul></p>
<p>Additional questions:<br>
<ul><li>How would a new cross-gov data management community add value to your work?</li>
<li>How would a cross-gov data management community collaborate with existing data communities and networks inside and outside of government? </li>
<li>How do we make sure the people who need it most can be a part of it? </li></ul><br>

<p>Local Authorities in Scotland have joined forces with the Digital Office for Scottish Local Government to understand how they can use data to achieve positive outcomes for their organisations, the wider sector, and citizens. The Data Task Force are also collaborating with the Scottish Government on a number of challenges from improving data maturity, the development of a Data Transformation Framework, and to make it easier to find public sector data through a CivTech Innovation Challenge.</p>
