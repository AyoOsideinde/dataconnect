<h2><div id="Wednesday-9-00am-to-10-00am-The-National-Digital-Twin-Programme">9.00am to 10.00am The National Digital Twin Programme</div></h2><p>The National Digital Twin (NDT) is envisaged to be an ecosystem of connected digital twins that will help to increase the performance of our existing built environment and improve the delivery of new infrastructure assets.  It promises enormous value for the people of the UK and is supported by infrastructure policy from the National Infrastructure Strategy, through the Construction Playbook to the recent Transforming Infrastructure Performance report.</p>
<p>The digital twin market is already taking off, but connecting digital twins is all about interoperability – enabling secure resilient information flow across organisational and sector boundaries – which is an essential enabler for achieving net zero, climate resilience and the circular economy.  But this requires a level of data quality and consistency that the market alone cannot initiate; it requires government-level leadership to create the conditions that will enable the connected digital twin market to develop and thrive.</p>
<p>This session will: introduce the National Digital Twin programme, provide a tangible example of its value and explain the essence of its technical foundation. All welcome.</p>

Drawing on principles from the soon to be published Data Sharing Governance Framework, we set out what a cross-government standardised and coordinated approach to the non-technical elements of data sharing can fix, what change looks like over time and how the not-so-usual suspects can support faster and easier data sharing.</p>
<p>Format: 4 x brief presentations and Q&A</p>

<p>Watch Paul Downey, Euan Mills, Katie Glaubius and Paul Smith talk about how we make land and housing data easier to find, use and trust.</p>
<p>Digital Land is a team in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities working aiming to make land and housing data easier to find, use and trust. We believe better, more easily consumed data will lead to better decisions and fewer uncertainties and delays in the housing system, and more new digital services for property and planning.<br>
This session will feature talks and demonstrations from our policy, user research, design and technical leads on the externalities and other barriers local planning authorities and other decision makers face making better data available.<br>
Come and hear about the team’s approach to collecting, processing, and presenting data, and providing feedback to publishers, and other ways the team have been exploring to help publishers overcome these barriers.<br>
This event is for designed for those working in local and national government.</p>

This event is an open discussion of the kinds of features we as data practitioners of various types would like to have in the data catalogues we use. The event is particularly aimed at people who actively interact with data catalogues of various kinds, who have a sense of the limitations of current systems and the capabilities we wish they had and sharing of any best-practices or principles.</p>
<p>Primary audience: data scientists, developers, data curators, data governance managers who use data catalogues and related tools. Also potentially useful to data team managers, CDOs and other leaders.</p>
