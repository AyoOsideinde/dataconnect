		<img src="/public/images/DataConnect21_logo.png" alt="DataConnect Week 2021" width="30%" style="margin: 0 0 40px 50px;">

		<p> 27 September to 1 October 2021. Hosted by the Data Standards Authority and the Government Data Quality Hub.</p>

		<p><a href="/public/images/dc21-sessionpack.pdf">Download this speaker guide as a PDF</a></p>

		<p>DataConnect21 is a week-long festival of all things data across government, local government and the UK public sector, running from 27 September to 1 October 2021.</p>

		<p>It's co-hosted by the Data Standards Authority (part of the Central Digital and Data Office at the Cabinet Office) and the Government Data Quality Hub at the Office for National Statistics.</p>

		<p>Anyone and everyone in the UK public sector interested in data will come together online to tell and hear stories about data in government and reflect on the wider effect that better use of data is having across the whole of government.

		<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell your story at DataConnect21</h1>
		<p>You're invited to take part. You do not need to be a data expert. We’re interested in hearing from a diverse range of people doing interesting work with data.</p>

		<p>DataConnect21 is a unique opportunity for you to connect with a wide audience to share your team’s data stories and successes.</p>

		<p>If you're outside the UK public sector, we’re still keen to hear from you.</p>

		<p>If you've built a service or carried out research using publicly available public sector and government data, please share your story.</p>

		<p>If you're working as a supplier to a public sector or government organisation, we'd really like to hear about your work. Ideally, sessions will be run in partnership, focusing on what you've achieved together rather than the capabilities of specific software or companies.



		<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What’s in it for you</h1>
		<p>Run your own session or event as a host, joining DWP Digital, Central Digital and Data Office, Office for National Statistics, Open Data Institute and many others who have already signed up to run sessions.</p>

		<p>If you host a session, DataConnect21 will connect you with people from across the public sector, central and local government – product owners, service delivery, operational and policy people as well as those from the digital, data and technology and analysis functions.</p>

		<p>You’ll be in good company. The following are some of the organisations that will be taking part:<br><br>

		<p>Tell us the topic of your session and what day and time you’d like to run it. Email us at <a href="mailto:dataconnect21@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">dataconnect21@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> as soon as you can.</p>

		<p>The DataConnect21 organising team will get back to you within 3 working days to confirm we’ve received your session pledge.</p>

		<p>Then you’ll need to:</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>plan the session - if you are running the session on your own, we can help if you email us</li>
		<li>use online meeting tools to run your session - we’ll send you information on accessibility and privacy as part of our support to you</li>
		<li>decide whether your session will be open to all or limited to a specific audience</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">The DataConnect21 organising team will provide:</h1>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an open schedule where you can add your session at the day and time you choose</li>
		<li>communications across government about the event, bringing a wide audience to your session</li>
		<li>advice and support on accessibility, technology and session planning to help you get the best out of your session</li>
		<li>open office hours to get advice, connect with other session hosts or test your setup</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Decide whether your session will be open or closed</h2>

		<p>This is something that you can choose, based on the content of your session. Please note that DataConnect21 will have a wide public sector and possibly private sector audience.</p>

		<p>Some people choose to share an open link, for example when using webinar software. Others chose to ask participants to email or register for the link so they can see who’s attending. Either way is fine and up to you.</p>
