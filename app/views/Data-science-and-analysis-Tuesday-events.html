<h2><div id="Tuesday-3-00pm-to-4-00pm-Data-Literacy-What-is-it-and-what-do-I-do-with-it-">3:00pm to 4:00pm Data Literacy – What is it and what do I do with it?</div></h2><p>Organisations are constantly looking for the competitive edge to remain successful, profitable and, ultimately, long-lasting.  Regardless of whether you work with a multi-national organisation or a government department, data is central to that success. What is becoming apparent is that the vast majority of employees within organisations don’t have the confidence with data to truly unlock its potential.   In fact, research shows that only 1 in 4 business decision makers would categorise themselves as being fully data literate. At executive level, this number is about 1 in 3. And, crucially, organisations don’t know what steps to take to rectify the skills gap – to place data literacy at the heart of their business.</p>
